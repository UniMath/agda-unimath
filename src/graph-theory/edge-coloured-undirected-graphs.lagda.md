## Idea

An **edge-coloured undirected graph** is an
[undirected graph](graph-theory.undirected-graphs.md) equipped with a family of
maps `E p → X` from the edges at
[unordered pairs](foundation.unordered-pairs.md) `p` into a type `C` of colours,
such that the induced map `incident-Undirected-Graph G x → C` is
[injective](foundation.injective-maps.md) for each vertex `x`.
