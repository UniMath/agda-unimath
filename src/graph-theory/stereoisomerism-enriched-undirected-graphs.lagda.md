## Idea

A **stereoisomerism** between two
[`(A,B)`-enriched undirected graphs](graph-theory.enriched-undirected-graphs.md)
is an [equivalence](graph-theory.equivalences-undirected-graphs.md) between
their underlying [undirected graphs](graph-theory.undirected-graphs.md)
preserving the shape of the vertices. This concept is derived from the concept
of stereoisomerism of chemical compounds.

**Note:** It could be that we only want the shapes to be merely preserved.

## Definition

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 l6 : Level} (A : UU l1) (B : A → UU l2)
  (G : Enriched-Undirected-Graph l3 l4 A B)
  (H : Enriched-Undirected-Graph l5 l6 A B)
  where

  stereoisomerism-Enriched-Undirected-Graph :
    UU (lsuc lzero ⊔ l1 ⊔ l3 ⊔ l4 ⊔ l5 ⊔ l6)
  stereoisomerism-Enriched-Undirected-Graph =
    Σ ( equiv-Undirected-Graph
        ( undirected-graph-Enriched-Undirected-Graph A B G)
        ( undirected-graph-Enriched-Undirected-Graph A B H))
      ( λ e →
        ( shape-vertex-Enriched-Undirected-Graph A B G) ~
        ( ( shape-vertex-Enriched-Undirected-Graph A B H) ∘
          ( vertex-equiv-Undirected-Graph
            ( undirected-graph-Enriched-Undirected-Graph A B G)
            ( undirected-graph-Enriched-Undirected-Graph A B H)
            ( e))))
