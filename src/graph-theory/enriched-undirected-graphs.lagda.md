## Idea

Consider a type `A` equipped with a type family `B` over `A`. An
**`(A,B)`-enriched undirected graph** is an
[undirected graph](graph-theory.undirected-graphs.md) `G := (V,E)` equipped with
a map `sh : V → A`, and for each vertex `v` an
[equivalence](foundation-core.equivalences.md) from `B (sh v)` to the type of
all edges going out of `v`, i.e., to the type `neighbor v` of
[neighbors](graph-theory.neighbors-undirected-graphs.md).

The map `sh : V → A` assigns to each vertex a shape, and with it an
[∞-group](higher-group-theory.higher-groups.md) `BAut (sh v)`. The type family
`B` restricted to `BAut (sh v)` is an
[`Aut (sh v)`-type](higher-group-theory.higher-group-actions.md), and the
equivalence `B (sh v) ≃ neighbor v` then ensures type type being acted on is
`neighbor v`.
