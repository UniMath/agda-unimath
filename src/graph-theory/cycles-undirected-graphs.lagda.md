## Idea

A
{{#concept "cycle" Agda=cycle-Undirected-Graph Disambiguation="undirected graph" WD="cycle" WDID=Q245595}}
in an [undirected graph](graph-theory.undirected-graphs.md) `G` consists of a
[`k`-gon](graph-theory.polygons.md) `H` equipped with an
[embedding of graphs](graph-theory.embeddings-undirected-graphs.md) from `H`
into `G`.

## Definition

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} (k : ℕ) (G : Undirected-Graph l1 l2)
  where

  cycle-Undirected-Graph : UU (lsuc lzero ⊔ l1 ⊔ l2)
  cycle-Undirected-Graph =
    Σ (Polygon k) (λ H → emb-Undirected-Graph (undirected-graph-Polygon k H) G)
```
