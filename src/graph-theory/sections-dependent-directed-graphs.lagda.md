## Idea

Consider a [dependent directed graph](graph-theory.dependent-directed-graphs.md)
`B` over a [directed graph](graph-theory.directed-graphs.md) `A`. A
{{#concept "section" Disambiguation="dependent directed graph" Agda=section-Dependent-Directed-Graph}}
`f` of `B` consists of

- A dependent function `f₀ : (x : A₀) → B₀ x`
- A family of dependent functions

  ```text
    f₁ : (e : A₁ x y) → B₁ e (f₀ x) (f₀ y)
  ```

  indexed by `x y : A₀`.

Note that [graph homomorphisms](graph-theory.morphisms-directed-graphs.md) from
`A` to `B` are sections of the constant dependent directed graph at `B` over
`A`.
