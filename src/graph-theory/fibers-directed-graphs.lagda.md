## Idea

Consider a vertex `x` in a [directed graph](graph-theory.directed-graphs.md)
`G`. The
{{#concept "fiber" Disambiguation="directed graph" Agda=fiber-Directed-Graph}}
of `G` at `x` is a [directed tree](trees.directed-trees.md) of which the type of
nodes consists of vertices `y` equipped with a
[walk](graph-theory.walks-directed-graphs.md) `w` from `y` to `x`, and the type
of edges from `(y , w)` to `(z , v)` consist of an edge `e : y → z` such that
`w ＝ cons e v`.

**Note:** The fiber of a directed graph should not be confused with the
[fiber of a morphism of directed graphs](graph-theory.fibers-morphisms-directed-graphs.md),
which is the
[dependent directed graph](graph-theory.dependent-directed-graphs.md) consisting
of the [fibers](foundation-core.fibers-of-maps.md) of the actions on vertices
and edges.
