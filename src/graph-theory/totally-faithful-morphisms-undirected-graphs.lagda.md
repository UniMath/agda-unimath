## Idea

A **totally faithful morphism of undirected graphs** is a
[morphism](graph-theory.morphisms-undirected-graphs.md) `f : G → H` of
[undirected graphs](graph-theory.undirected-graphs.md) such that for edge `e` in
`H` there is at most one edge in `G` that `f` maps to `e`.

## Definition

```agda

  is-totally-faithful-hom-Undirected-Graph :
    hom-Undirected-Graph G H → UU (lsuc lzero ⊔ l1 ⊔ l2 ⊔ l4)
  is-totally-faithful-hom-Undirected-Graph f =
    is-emb (tot (edge-hom-Undirected-Graph G H f))
