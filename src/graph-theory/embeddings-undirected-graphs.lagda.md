## Idea

An **embedding of undirected graphs** is a
[morphism](graph-theory.morphisms-undirected-graphs.md) `f : G → H` of
[undirected graphs](graph-theory.undirected-graphs.md) which is an
[embedding](foundation.embeddings.md) on vertices such that for each
[unordered pair](foundation.unordered-pairs.md) `p` of vertices in `G` the map

```text
  edge-hom-Undirected-Graph G H :
    edge-Undirected-Graph G p →
    edge-Undirected-Graph H (unordered-pair-vertices-hom-Undirected-Graph G H f)
```

is also an embedding. Embeddings of undirected graphs correspond to undirected
subgraphs.

**Note:** Our notion of embeddings of directed graphs differs quite
substantially from the graph theoretic notion of _graph embedding_, which
usually refers to an embedding of a graph into the plane.
