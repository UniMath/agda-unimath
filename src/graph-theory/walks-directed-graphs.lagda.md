## Idea

A **walk** in a [directed graph](graph-theory.directed-graphs.md) from a vertex
`x` to a vertex `y` is a [list](lists.lists.md) of edges that connect `x` to
`y`. Since every journey begins with a single step, we define the `cons`
operation on walks in directed graphs with an edge from the source in the first
argument, and a walk to the target in the second argument.

## Definitions

### The type of walks from `x` to `y` in `G`
