## Idea

A
{{#concept "wide displayed large reflexive graph" Agda=Wide-Displayed-Large-Reflexive-Graph}}
is a
[displayed large reflexive graph](graph-theory.displayed-large-reflexive-graphs.md)
over a base [large reflexive graph](graph-theory.large-reflexive-graphs.md) `G`
that does not add structure on the vertices, but only the edges.

**Terminology.** The use of the term "wide" here is motivated by the idea that a
"wide displayed graph" should generalize "wide subgraphs", i.e., a subgraph
which contains all vertices, in the same way "displayed graphs" generalize
"subgraphs".
