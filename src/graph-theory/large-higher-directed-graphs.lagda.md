## Idea

A {{#concept "large directed $n$-graph" Agda=Large-Higher-Directed-Graph}} is
defined inductively:

- A large directed $0$-graph is a large collection of vertices.
- A large directed $n+1$-graph is a large collection of vertices together with a
  [large binary relation](foundation.large-binary-relations.md) `E` on the
  vertices, such that `E u v` is a
  [(small) directed $n$-graph](graph-theory.higher-directed-graphs.md) for all
  `u` and `v`.

## Definitions

### The structure of a large higher directed graph on a large collection of vertices

```agda

  {α : Level → Level}
  (β γ : Level → Level → Level)
  (V : (l : Level) → UU (α l)) :
  (n : ℕ) → UUω
  where

  cons-zero-is-large-higher-directed-graph :
    is-large-higher-directed-graph β γ V 0

  cons-base-is-large-higher-directed-graph :
    Large-Relation β V → is-large-higher-directed-graph β γ V 1

    is-large-higher-directed-graph β γ V (succ-ℕ (succ-ℕ n))
