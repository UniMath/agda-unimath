## Idea

The {{#concept "universal directed graph" Agda=universal-Directed-Graph}} `𝒢 l`
at [universe level](foundation.universe-levels.md) `l` is the
[directed graph](graph-theory.directed-graphs.md) that has the universe `UU l`
as its type of vertices, and spans between types as its edges.

Specifically, the universal directed graph is a translation from category theory
into type theory of the Hofmann–Streicher universe {{#cite Awodey22}} of
presheaves on the representing pair of arrows

```text
      s
    ----->
  0 -----> 1
      t
```

The Hofmann–Streicher universe of presheaves on a category `𝒞` is the presheaf

```text
     𝒰_𝒞 I := Presheaf 𝒞/I
  El_𝒞 I A := A *,
```

where `*` is the terminal object of `𝒞/I`, i.e., the identity morphism on `I`.

We compute the instances of the slice category `⇉/I`:

- The slice category `⇉/0` is the terminal category.
- The slice category `⇉/1` is the representing cospan

  ```text
        s         t
    s -----> 1 <----- t
  ```

  The functors `s t : ⇉/0 → ⇉/1` are given by `* ↦ s` and `* ↦ t`, respectively.

This means that:

- The type of vertices of the universal directed graph is the universe of types
  `UU l`.
- The type of edges from `X` to `Y` of the universal directed graph is the type
  of spans from `X` to `Y`.

There is a
[directed graph duality theorem](graph-theory.directed-graph-duality.md), which
asserts that for any directed graph `G`, the type of
[morphisms](graph-theory.morphisms-directed-graphs.md) `hom G 𝒰` from `G` into
the universal directed graph is [equivalent](foundation-core.equivalences.md) to
the type of pairs `(H , f)` consisting of a directed graph `H` and a morphism
`f : hom H G` from `H` into `G`.

## Properties

### Every dependent directed graph is a base change of the universal dependent directed graph

#### The characteristic morphism of a dependent directed graph
