## Idea

A
{{#concept "directed graph structure" WD="directed graph" WDID=Q1137726 Agda=structure-directed-graph-Fin}}
on a [standard finite set](univalent-combinatorics.standard-finite-types.md)
`Fin n` is a [binary type valued relation](foundation.binary-relations.md)

```text
  Fin n → Fin n → 𝒰.
```

## Definitions

### Directed graph structures on standard finite sets

```agda
structure-directed-graph-Fin : (l : Level) (n : ℕ) → UU (lsuc l)
structure-directed-graph-Fin l n = Fin n → Fin n → UU l
```

### Directed graphs on standard finite sets

```agda
Directed-Graph-Fin : (l : Level) → UU (lsuc l)
Directed-Graph-Fin l = Σ ℕ (structure-directed-graph-Fin l)
```

### Labeled finite directed graphs on standard finite sets

A
{{#concept "labeled finite directed graph" Agda=Labeled-Finite-Directed-Graph}}
consists of a [natural number](elementary-number-theory.natural-numbers.md) `n`
and a map `Fin n → Fin n → ℕ`.

```agda
Labeled-Finite-Directed-Graph : UU lzero
Labeled-Finite-Directed-Graph = Σ ℕ (λ n → Fin n → Fin n → ℕ)
```
