## Idea

An **Eulerian circuit** in an
[undirected graph](graph-theory.undirected-graphs.md) `G` consists of a
[circuit](graph-theory.circuits-undirected-graphs.md) `T` in `G` such that every
edge in `G` is in the image of `T`. In other words, an Eulerian circuit `T`
consists of [`k`-gon](graph-theory.polygons.md) `H` equipped with a
[graph homomorphism](graph-theory.morphisms-undirected-graphs.md) `f : H → G`
that induces an [equivalence](foundation-core.equivalences.md)

```text
  Σ (unordered-pair-vertices-Polygon k H) (edge-Polygon k H) ≃
  Σ (unordered-pair-vertices-Undirected-Graph G) (edge-Undirected-Graph G)
```

## Definition

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} (G : Undirected-Graph l1 l2)
  where

  eulerian-circuit-Undirected-Graph : UU (lsuc lzero ⊔ l1 ⊔ l2)
  eulerian-circuit-Undirected-Graph =
    Σ ( ℕ)
      ( λ k →
        Σ ( Polygon k)
          ( λ H →
            Σ ( hom-Undirected-Graph (undirected-graph-Polygon k H) G)
              ( λ f →
                is-equiv
                  ( tot
                    ( edge-hom-Undirected-Graph
                      ( undirected-graph-Polygon k H)
                      ( G)
                      ( f))))))
