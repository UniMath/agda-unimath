## Idea

A **faithful morphism of undirected graphs** is a
[morphism](graph-theory.morphisms-undirected-graphs.md) `f : G → H` of
[undirected graphs](graph-theory.undirected-graphs.md) such that for each
[unordered pair](foundation.unordered-pairs.md) `p` of vertices in `G` the map

```text
  edge-hom-Undirected-Graph G H f p :
    edge-Undirected-Graph G p →
    edge-Undirected-Graph H
      ( unordered-pair-vertices-hom-Undirected-Graph G H f p)
```

is an [embedding](foundation.embeddings.md).
