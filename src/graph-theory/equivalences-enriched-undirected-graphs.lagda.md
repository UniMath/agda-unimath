## Idea

An **equivalence of `(A,B)`-enriched undirected graphs** from an
[`(A,B)`-enriched undirected graph](graph-theory.enriched-undirected-graphs.md)
`G` to an `(A,B)`-enriched undirected graph `H` consists of an
[equivalence](graph-theory.equivalences-undirected-graphs.md) `e` of the
underlying graphs of `G` and `H` such that preserving the labeling and the
[equivalences](foundation-core.equivalences.md) on the
[neighbors](graph-theory.neighbors-undirected-graphs.md).
