## Idea

Given a [dependent directed graph](graph-theory.dependent-directed-graphs.md)
`B` over a [directed graphs](graph-theory.directed-graphs.md) `A`, the
{{#concept "dependent product" Disambiguation="directed graph" agda=Π-Directed-Graph}}
`Π A B` is the directed graph that satisfies the universal property

```text
  hom X (Π A B) ≃ section (X × A) (pr2* B).
```

Concretely, the directed graph `Π A B` has

- The type of functions `(x : A₀) → B₀ x` as its type of vertices
- For any two functions `f₀ g₀ : (x : A₀) → B₀ x`, an edge from `f₀` to `g₀` is
  an element of type

  ```text
    (x y : A₀) → A₁ x y → B₁ (f₀ x) (g₀ y).
  ```

The universal property of the dependent product gives that the type of
[sections](graph-theory.sections-dependent-directed-graphs.md) of `B` is
[equivalent](foundation-core.equivalences.md) to the type of morphisms from the
[terminal directed graph](graph-theory.terminal-directed-graphs.md) into
`Π A B`, which is in turn equivalent to the type of vertices `f₀` of the
dependent product `Π A B` equipped with a loop `(Π A B)₁ f f`. Indeed, this data
consists of:

- A map `f₀ : A₀ → B₀`
- A family of maps `f₁ : (x y : A₀) → A₁ x y → B₁ (f₀ x) (f₀ y)`,

as expected for the type of sections of a dependent directed graph.
