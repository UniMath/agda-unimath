## Idea

Since the [natural numbers](elementary-number-theory.natural-numbers.md) only form a [commutative semiring](elementary-number-theory.commutative-semiring-of-natural-numbers.md), their ideals aren't as easily defined as [ideals](ring-theory.ideals-rings.md) on a [ring](ring-theory.rings.md)
