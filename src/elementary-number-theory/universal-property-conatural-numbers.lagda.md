## Idea

The [conatural numbers](elementary-number-theory.conatural-numbers.md) `ℕ∞`
enjoys many universal properties, among others:

1. It is the one-point compactification of the
   [natural numbers](elementary-number-theory.natural-numbers.md).
2. It classifies downward-stable subsets of the natural numbers.
3. It is the final coalgebra of the [maybe monad](foundation.maybe.md).

On this page we consider the last of these. Thus, a
`Maybe`-[coalgebra](foundation.coalgebras-maybe.md) `η : X → Maybe X` satisfies
the
{{#concept "universal property of the conatural numbers" Agda=universal-property-conatural-numbers}}
if, for every other `Maybe`-coalgebra `η' : Y → Maybe Y` there is a
[unique](foundation-core.contractible-types.md)
[coalgebra homomorphism](foundation.morphisms-coalgebras-maybe.md)

     Y ----------> X
     |             |
   η'|             | η
     ∨             ∨
  Maybe Y ----> Maybe X.
         Maybe f
```
