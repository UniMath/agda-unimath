## Idea

A **factorization into
[global function classes](orthogonal-factorization-systems.global-function-classes.md)
classes `L` and `R`** of a map `f : A → B` is a pair of maps `l : A → X` and
`r : X → B`, where `l ∈ L` and `r ∈ R`, such that their composite `r ∘ l` is
`f`.

```text
         X
        ∧ \
 L ∋ l /   \ r ∈ R
      /     ∨
    A -----> B
        f
```
