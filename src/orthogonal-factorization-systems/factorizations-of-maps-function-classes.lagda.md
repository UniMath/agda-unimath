## Idea

A **function class factorization** of a map `f : A → B` into
[function classes](orthogonal-factorization-systems.function-classes.md) `L` and
`R` is a pair of maps `l : A → X` and `r : X → B`, where `l ∈ L` and `r ∈ R`,
such that their composite `r ∘ l` is `f`.

```text
         X
        ∧ \
 L ∋ l /   \ r ∈ R
      /     ∨
    A -----> B
        f
```

## Properties

### Characterization of identifications of factorizations of a map into function classes

**Proof:** This follows immediately from the characterization of identifications
of factorizations using the
[subtype identity principle](foundation.subtype-identity-principle.md).

What follows is a long list of auxillary definitions.

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 l3 lL lR : Level}
  (L : function-class l1 l3 lL)
  (R : function-class l3 l2 lR)
  {A : UU l1} {B : UU l2} (f : A → B)
  where

  equiv-function-class-factorization :
    (F E : function-class-factorization L R f) → UU (l1 ⊔ l2 ⊔ l3)
  equiv-function-class-factorization F E =
    equiv-factorization f
      ( factorization-function-class-factorization L R F)
      ( factorization-function-class-factorization L R E)

  id-equiv-function-class-factorization :
    (F : function-class-factorization L R f) →
    equiv-function-class-factorization F F
  id-equiv-function-class-factorization F =
    id-equiv-factorization f
      ( factorization-function-class-factorization L R F)

  equiv-eq-function-class-factorization :
    (F E : function-class-factorization L R f) →
    F ＝ E → equiv-function-class-factorization F E
  equiv-eq-function-class-factorization F E p =
    equiv-eq-factorization f
      ( factorization-function-class-factorization L R F)
      ( factorization-function-class-factorization L R E)
      ( ap pr1 p)

  is-torsorial-equiv-function-class-factorization :
    (F : function-class-factorization L R f) →
    is-torsorial (equiv-function-class-factorization F)
  is-torsorial-equiv-function-class-factorization F =
    is-torsorial-Eq-subtype
      ( is-torsorial-equiv-factorization f
        ( factorization-function-class-factorization L R F))
      ( is-prop-is-function-class-factorization L R)
      ( factorization-function-class-factorization L R F)
      ( id-equiv-function-class-factorization F)
      ( is-function-class-factorization-function-class-factorization L R F)

  is-equiv-equiv-eq-function-class-factorization :
    (F E : function-class-factorization L R f) →
    is-equiv (equiv-eq-function-class-factorization F E)
  is-equiv-equiv-eq-function-class-factorization F =
    fundamental-theorem-id
      ( is-torsorial-equiv-function-class-factorization F)
      ( equiv-eq-function-class-factorization F)

  extensionality-function-class-factorization :
    (F E : function-class-factorization L R f) →
    (F ＝ E) ≃ (equiv-function-class-factorization F E)
  pr1 (extensionality-function-class-factorization F E) =
    equiv-eq-function-class-factorization F E
  pr2 (extensionality-function-class-factorization F E) =
    is-equiv-equiv-eq-function-class-factorization F E

  eq-equiv-function-class-factorization :
    (F E : function-class-factorization L R f) →
    equiv-function-class-factorization F E → F ＝ E
  eq-equiv-function-class-factorization F E =
    map-inv-equiv (extensionality-function-class-factorization F E)
