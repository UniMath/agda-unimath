## Idea

A map `f : A ‚Üí B` is said to be **`k`-cellular** if it satisfies the left
[mere lifting propery](orthogonal-factorization-systems.mere-lifting-properties.md)
with respect to [`k`-connected maps](foundation.connected-maps.md). In other
words, a map `f` is `k`-cellular if the
[pullback-hom](orthogonal-factorization-systems.pullback-hom.md)

```text
  ‚ü® f , g ‚ü©
```

with any `k`-connected map `g` is [surjective](foundation.surjective-maps.md).
The terminology `k`-cellular comes from the fact that the `k`-connected maps are
precisely the maps that satisfy the right mere lifting property wtih respect to
the [spheres](synthetic-homotopy-theory.spheres.md)

```text
  S‚Å± ‚Üí unit
```

for all `-1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ k`. In this sense, `k`-cellular maps are "built out of
spheres". Alternatively, `k`-cellular maps might also be called **`k`-projective
maps**. This emphasizes the condition that `k`-projective maps lift against
`k`-connected maps.

In the topos of spaces, the `k`-cellular maps are the left class of an
_external_ weak factorization system on spaces of which the right class is the
class of `k`-connected maps, but there is no such weak factorization system
definable internally.

## Definitions

### The predicate of being a `k`-cellular map

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} (k : ùïã) {A : UU l1} {B : UU l2} (f : A ‚Üí B)
  where

  is-cellular-map : UUœâ
  is-cellular-map =
    {l3 l4 : Level} {X : UU l3} {Y : UU l4} (g : X ‚Üí Y) ‚Üí
    is-connected-map k g ‚Üí mere-diagonal-lift f g
```
