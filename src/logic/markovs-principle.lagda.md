## Idea

{{#concept "Markov's principle" WDID=Q3922074 WD="Markov's principle" Agda=Markov's-Principle}}
asserts that if a [decidable subtype](foundation.decidable-subtypes.md) `𝒫` of
the [natural numbers](elementary-number-theory.natural-numbers.md) `ℕ` is not
[full](foundation.full-subtypes.md), then
[there is](foundation.existential-quantification.md) a natural number `n` that
is not in `𝒫`.

Markov's principle is an example of a _constructive taboo_. It is a consequence
of the [law of excluded middle](foundation.law-of-excluded-middle.md) that is
not provable generally in constructive mathematics.

## Definitions

### Markov's principle

```agda
Markov's-Principle : UU lzero
Markov's-Principle = is-markovian ℕ
```

## Properties

### Markov's principle is constructively valid for upwards closed subtypes

**Proof.** Assume given an ascending chain of decidable propositions `Pᵢ ⇒ Pᵢ₊₁`
indexed by the natural numbers `ℕ`. This gives a decidable subtype `𝒫` of `ℕ`
given by `i ∈ 𝒫` iff `Pᵢ` is true. Observe that if `i ∈ 𝒫` then every `j ≥ i` is
also in `𝒫`, and there must exist a least such `i ∈ 𝒫`. Therefore,
`𝒫 = Σ (m ∈ ℕ) (m ≥ k)` for some `k`. So, if `¬ (∀ᵢ Pᵢ)` it is necessarily the
case that `¬ P₀`.
