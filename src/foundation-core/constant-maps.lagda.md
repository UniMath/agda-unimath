# Constant maps

## Idea

The {{#concept "constant map" Agda=const}} from `A` to `B` at an element `b : B`
is the function `x ↦ b` mapping every element `x : A` to the given element
`b : B`. In common type theoretic notation, the constant map at `b` is the
function

```text
  λ x → b.
```

## Definition

```agda
const : {l1 l2 : Level} (A : UU l1) {B : UU l2} → B → A → B
const A b x = b
```
