## Idea

A [(two-sided) inverse](foundation-core.invertible-maps.md) for a map
`f : A → B` is a map `g : B → A` equipped with
[homotopies](foundation-core.homotopies.md) ` S : f ∘ g ~ id` and
`R : g ∘ f ~ id`. Such data, however is [structure](foundation.structure.md) on
the map `f`, and not generally a [property](foundation-core.propositions.md).
One way to make the type of inverses into a property is by adding a single
coherence condition between the homotopies of the inverse, asking that the
following diagram commmutes

```text
               S ·r f
             ~~~~~~~~~~
  f ∘ g ∘ f             f.
             ~~~~~~~~~~
               f ·l R
```

We call such data a
{{#concept "coherently invertible map" Agda=coherently-invertible-map}}. I.e., a
coherently invertible map `f : A → B` is a map equipped with a two-sided inverse
and this additional coherence.

There is also the alternative coherence condition we could add

```text
               R ·r g
             ~~~~~~~~~~
  g ∘ f ∘ g             g.
             ~~~~~~~~~~
               g ·l S
```

We will colloquially refer to invertible maps equipped with this coherence for
_transpose coherently invertible maps_.

**Note.** Coherently invertible maps are referred to as
{{#concept "half adjoint equivalences"}} in _Homotopy Type Theory – Univalent
Foundations of Mathematics_.

### Coherently invertible maps are embeddings

We first construct the converse map to the
[action on identifications](foundation.action-on-identifications-functions.md).
This is a rerun of the proof that maps with
[retractions](foundation-core.retractions.md) are
[injective](foundation-core.injective-maps.md) (`is-injective-retraction`), and
we repeat the proof to avoid cyclic dependencies.

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} {A : UU l1} {B : UU l2} {f : A → B}
  (H : is-coherently-invertible f) {x y : A}
  where

  map-inv-ap-is-coherently-invertible : f x ＝ f y → x ＝ y
  map-inv-ap-is-coherently-invertible p =
    ( inv (is-retraction-map-inv-is-coherently-invertible H x)) ∙
    ( ( ap (map-inv-is-coherently-invertible H) p) ∙
      ( is-retraction-map-inv-is-coherently-invertible H y))
```

Next, we show that this converse map is a [section](foundation-core.sections.md)
and retraction of `ap f`.

```agda
  abstract
    is-section-map-inv-ap-is-coherently-invertible :
      ap f ∘ map-inv-ap-is-coherently-invertible ~ id
    is-section-map-inv-ap-is-coherently-invertible p =

### The inverse of a coherently invertible map is transpose coherently invertible

Of course there is also a converse construction, and since these just move data
around, they are strict inverses to one another.

### Coherently invertible maps are coherently invertible in both senses

This is Lemma 4.2.2 in _Homotopy Type Theory – Univalent Foundations of
Mathematics_.

By naturality we have

```text

     gfgfg --------------------> gfg
       |                          |

```

Pasting the two lemmas along the common edge `gfgS`,

```text
             Rg
      gfg ---------> g
       ∧             ∧
  Rgfg |             | Rg
       |             |
     gfgfg --gfgS-> gfg
       |             |
  Rgfg |             | Rg
       ∨             ∨
      gfg ---------> g
             gS
```

or along the common edge `Rgfg`

```text
             gfgS        gfgS
      gfg <------> gfgfg -------> gfg
       |             |             |
    Rg |            Rgfg           | Rg
       ∨             ∨             ∨
       g <--------- gfg ---------> g
             Rg             gS
```

We observe that the left-hand and right-hand side cancel each other out, leaving
us with a homotopy `Rg ~ gS` as desired.

    coherence-is-transpose-coherently-invertible f g S R
  coherence-is-transpose-coherently-invertible-coherence-is-coherently-invertible =
