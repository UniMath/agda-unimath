## Idea

A
{{#concept "rational neighborhood relation" Agda=Rational-Neighborhood-Relation}}
is a type family of
[proposition-valued binary relations](foundation.binary-relations.md) indexed by
the
[positive rational numbers](elementary-number-theory.positive-rational-numbers.md).

Given a rational neighborhood relation `N` on `A` and some positive rational
number `d : ℚ⁺` such that `N d x y` holds for some pair of points `x y : A`, we
interpret `d` as an
{{#concept "upper bound" Disambiguation="on the distance with respect to a rational neighborhood relation" Agda=is-upper-bound-dist-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation}}
on the distance between `x` and `y` with respect to the rational neighborhood
relation.
