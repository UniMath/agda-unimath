## Idea

A [rational neighborhood relation](metric-spaces.rational-neighborhoods.md) `U`
on a type `A` is
{{#concept "finer" Disambiguation="rational neighborhood relation on a type" Agda=leq-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation}}
than another rational neighborhood relation `V` if `(U d)`-neighborhoods are
`(V d)`-neighborhoods for any
[positive rational](elementary-number-theory.positive-rational-numbers.md) `d`,
i.e., if any upper bound on the distance between two points in `U` also bounds
their distance in `V`. This is a [partial order](order-theory.posets.md) on the
type of rational neighborhood relations on `A`.

## Definitions

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} {A : UU l1} (U V : Rational-Neighborhood-Relation l2 A)
  where

## Properties

### The ordering on rational neighborhood relations is reflexive

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} {A : UU l1} (U : Rational-Neighborhood-Relation l2 A)
  where

  refl-leq-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation :
    leq-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation U U
  refl-leq-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation d x y H = H

  leq-eq-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation :
    (V : Rational-Neighborhood-Relation l2 A) →
    (U ＝ V) →
    leq-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation U V
  leq-eq-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation .U refl =
    refl-leq-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation
```

### The ordering on rational neighborhood relations is transitive

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} {A : UU l1} (U V W : Rational-Neighborhood-Relation l2 A)
  where

  transitive-leq-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation :
    leq-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation V W →
    leq-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation U V →
    leq-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation U W
  transitive-leq-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation H K d x y = H d x y ∘ K d x y
```

### The ordering on rational neighborhood relations is antisymmetric

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} {A : UU l1} (U V : Rational-Neighborhood-Relation l2 A)
  where

  antisymmetric-leq-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation :
    leq-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation U V →
    leq-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation V U →
    U ＝ V
  antisymmetric-leq-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation I J =
    eq-Eq-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation
      ( U)
      ( V)
      ( λ d x y → (I d x y , J d x y))
```

### The poset of rational neighborhood relations on a type

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} (A : UU l1)
  where

  preorder-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation : Preorder (l1 ⊔ lsuc l2) (l1 ⊔ l2)
  pr1 preorder-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation =
    Rational-Neighborhood-Relation l2 A
  pr2 preorder-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation =
    leq-prop-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation ,
    refl-leq-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation ,
    transitive-leq-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation

  poset-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation : Poset (l1 ⊔ lsuc l2) (l1 ⊔ l2)
  poset-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation =
    preorder-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation ,
    antisymmetric-leq-Rational-Neighborhood-Relation
