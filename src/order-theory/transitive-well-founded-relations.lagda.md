## Idea

A
{{#concept "transitive well-founded relation" Agda=Transitive-Well-Founded-Relation}}
is a [transitive](foundation.binary-relations.md)
[well-founded relation](order-theory.well-founded-relations.md).

## Definitions

### The predicate of being a transitive well-founded relation

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} {X : UU l1} (R : Relation l2 X)
  where

  is-transitive-well-founded-relation-Relation : UU (l1 ⊔ l2)
  is-transitive-well-founded-relation-Relation =
    is-well-founded-Relation R × is-transitive R
```

### Transitive well-founded relations

  Σ (Relation l2 X) is-transitive-well-founded-relation-Relation

### The associated reflexive relation of a transitive well-founded relation

Given a transitive well-founded relation `P` there is an associated reflexive
relation given by

$$
  (x ≤ y) := (u : X) → u ∈ x → u ∈ y.
$$

  {l1 l2 : Level} {X : UU l1} (R : Transitive-Well-Founded-Relation l2 X)
