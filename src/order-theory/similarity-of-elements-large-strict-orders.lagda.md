## Idea

Two elements `x` and `y` of a
[large strict order](order-theory.large-strict-orders.md) `A` are said to be
{{#concept "similar" Disambiguation="elements of a large strict order" Agda=sim-Large-Strict-Order}},
or **indiscernible**, if for every `z : A` we have

- `z < x` [if and only if](foundation.logical-equivalences.md) `z < y`, and
- `x < z` if and only if `y < z`.

We refer to the first condition as
{{#concept "similarity from below" Disambiguation="of elements of a large strict order" Agda=sim-from-below-Large-Strict-Order}}
and the second condition as
{{#concept "similarity from above" Disambiguation="of elements of a large strict order" Agda=sim-from-above-Large-Strict-Order}}.

In informal writing we will use the notation `x ≈ y` to assert that `x` and `y`
are similar elements in a large strict order `A`.
