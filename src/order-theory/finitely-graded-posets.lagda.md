## Idea

A **finitely graded poset** consists of a family of types indexed by
`Fin (succ-ℕ k)` equipped with an ordering relation from `Fin (inl i)` to
`Fin (succ-Fin (inl i))` for each `i : Fin k`.

```agda
Finitely-Graded-Poset : (l1 l2 : Level) (k : ℕ) → UU (lsuc l1 ⊔ lsuc l2)
Finitely-Graded-Poset l1 l2 k =
  Σ ( Fin (succ-ℕ k) → Set l1)
    ( λ X →
      (i : Fin k) → type-Set (X (inl-Fin k i)) →
      type-Set (X (succ-Fin (succ-ℕ k) (inl-Fin k i))) → Prop l2)

If chains with jumps are never used, we'd like to call the following chains.

### Least and largest elements in finitely graded posets

We make sure that the least element is a face of type zero-Fin, and that the
largest element is a face of type neg-one-Fin.
