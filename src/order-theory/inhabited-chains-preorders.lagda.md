## Idea

An
{{#concept "inhabited chain" Disambiguation="in a preorder" Agda=inhabited-chain-Preorder}}
in a [preorder](order-theory.preorders.md) `P` is a
[subtype](foundation-core.subtypes.md) `S` of `P` such that the ordering of `P`
restricted to `S` is [linear](order-theory.total-preorders.md) and
[inhabited](foundation.inhabited-types.md).
