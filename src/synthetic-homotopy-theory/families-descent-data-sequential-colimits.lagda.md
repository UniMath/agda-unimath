## Idea

As shown in
[`descent-property-sequential-colimits`](synthetic-homotopy-theory.descent-property-sequential-colimits.md),
the type of type families over
[sequential colimits](synthetic-homotopy-theory.universal-property-sequential-colimits.md)
is [equivalent](foundation-core.equivalences.md) to
[descent data](synthetic-homotopy-theory.descent-data-sequential-colimits.md).

Sometimes it is useful to consider tripes `(P, B, e)` where `P : X ‚Üí ùí∞` is a
type family, `B` is descent data, and `e` is an equivalence between `B` and the
descent data induced by `P`. The type of such pairs `(B, e)` is
[contractible](foundation-core.contractible-types.md), so the type of these
triples is equivalent to the type of type families over `X`, but it may be more
ergonomic to characterize descent data of a particular type family, and then
have theorems know about this characterization, rather than transporting along
such a characterization after the fact.
