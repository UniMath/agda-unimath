## Idea

A [cocone under a span](synthetic-homotopy-theory.cocones-under-spans.md) of
[pointed types](structured-types.pointed-types.md) is a **pointed cocone** if it
consists of [pointed maps](structured-types.pointed-maps.md) equipped with a
[pointed homotopy](structured-types.pointed-homotopies.md) witnessing that the
naturality square
[commutes](structured-types.commuting-squares-of-pointed-maps.md).

The type of pointed cocones under a span of pointed types is again canonically
pointed at the constant cocone, with `refl` as coherence proof.

## Definition

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 l3 : Level}
  {S : Pointed-Type l1} {A : Pointed-Type l2}
  {B : Pointed-Type l3}
  (f : S →∗ A) (g : S →∗ B)
  where

  cocone-Pointed-Type :
    {l4 : Level} → Pointed-Type l4 → UU (l1 ⊔ l2 ⊔ l3 ⊔ l4)
  cocone-Pointed-Type X =
    Σ ( A →∗ X)
      ( λ i →
        Σ ( B →∗ X)
          ( λ j → coherence-square-pointed-maps g f j i))
```
