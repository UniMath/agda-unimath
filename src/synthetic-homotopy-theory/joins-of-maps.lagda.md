## Idea

Consider two maps `f : A → X` and `g : B → X` with a common codomain. The
**join** `f * g` of `f` and `g` is defined as the
[cogap map](synthetic-homotopy-theory.pushouts.md) of the
[pullback square](foundation.pullbacks.md)

```text
             π₂
   A ×_X B -----> B
     | ⌟          |
  π₁ |            | g
     ∨            ∨
     A ---------> X.
           f
```

We often write `A *_X B` for the domain of the fiberwise join. In other words,
the cogap map of any cartesian square

```text
        j
    A -----> X
    | ⌟      |
  f |        | g
    ∨        ∨
    B -----> Y
        i
```

is the join of `i` and `g`. The join of maps is also called the **fiberwise
join** because for each `x : X` we have an
[equivalence](foundation-core.equivalences.md)

```text
  fiber (f * g) x ≃ (fiber f x) * (fiber g x)
```

from the [fiber](foundation-core.fibers-of-maps.md) of `f * g` to the
[join](synthetic-homotopy-theory.joins-of-types.md) of the fibers of `f` and
`g`. In other words, there is a
[commuting triangle](foundation.commuting-triangles-of-maps.md)

```text
            ≃
   A *_X B --> Σ (x : X), (fiber f x) * (fiber g x)
        \       /
         \     /
          \   /
           ∨ ∨
            X.
```

in which the top map is an equivalence. The join of maps is related to the
[pushout-product](synthetic-homotopy-theory.pushout-products.md), because it
fits in a [pullback diagram](foundation.pullbacks.md)

```text
      A *_X B ------> (X × B) ⊔_{A × B} (A × X)
        | ⌟                   |
  f * g |                     | f □ g
        ∨                     ∨
        X ----------------> X × X.
                 Δ
```

A second way in which the pushout-product is related to the join of maps, is
that there is a commuting triangle

```text
                              ≃
  (X × B) ⊔_{A × B} (A × X) ----> (A × Y) *_{X × Y} (X × B)
                        \           /
                   f □ g \         / (f × id) * (id × g)
                          \       /
                           ∨     ∨
                            X × Y
```

This is an immediate consequence of the fact that the ambient square of the
pushout-product is cartesian, and therefore its cogap map is the join of the two
terminal maps in the square.
