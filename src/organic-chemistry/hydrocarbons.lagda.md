## Idea

We define the type of all theoretically possible hydrocarbons, correctly
accounting for the symmetries between hydrocarbons and the different isomers.

Hydrocarbons are built out of carbon and hydrogen atoms. The symmetry group of
an isolated carbon atom in 3-space is the alternating group `A₄`, where the
number 4 comes from the number of bonds a carbon atom makes in a molecule.

Bonds in hydrocarbons can appear as single bonds, double bonds, and triple
bonds, but there are no quadruple bonds.

We define hydrocarbons to be graphs equipped with a family of tetrahedra in
3-dimensional space indexed by the vertices and for each vertex `c` an embedding
from the type of all edges incident to `c` into the vertices of the tetrahedron
associated to `c`, satisfying the following conditions:

- There are at most 3 edges between any two vertices
- The graph contains no loops
- The graph is connected
