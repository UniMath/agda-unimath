## Idea

In univalent type theory, what we refer to formally as a _set_ is only in one
sense what is classically understood to be a "set". Namely, we say a set is a
type whose [equality relation](foundation-core.identity-types.md) is a
[proposition](foundation-core.propositions.md). I.e., any two elements can be
equal in [at most one](foundation.subterminal-types.md) way.

However, both historically {{#cite FBL73}} and in contemporary mathematics
{{#cite Kunen11}}, what is usually meant by set theory is the study of a
collection of related formal theories whose building blocks include a concept of
_sets_ and a propositionally valued _elementhood relation_, or _membership
relation_, `∈` on them.

While this elementhood relation is not built into Martin–Löf type theory as a
fundamental construct, there is one important instance of it present — namely,
the [smallness](foundation-core.small-types.md) predicate:

```text
  is-small l A := Σ (X : UU l), (A ≃ X).
```

We can say that a type `A` _is an element of_ `UU l` if `A` is `UU l`-small in
this sense. Indeed, that `is-small l` is a predicate is equivalent to the
[univalence axiom](foundation-core.univalence.md). This highlights a second
connection between set theory and univalent type theory that is not directly
compatible with the preconception that "set theory is a study of set-level
mathematics". More concretely, the universe of sets need not itself be a
set-level structure. In fact, assuming univalence, it is a proper
[groupoid](foundation-core.1-types.md).

In this module, we consider ideas historically related to the study of set
theories both as foundations of set-level mathematics, but also as a study of
hierarchies in mathematics. This includes ideas such as
[cardinality](set-theory.cardinalities.md) and
[infinity](set-theory.infinite-sets.md), the
[cumulative hierarchy](set-theory.cumulative-hierarchy.md) as a model of set
theory, and [Russell's paradox](set-theory.russells-paradox.md).
