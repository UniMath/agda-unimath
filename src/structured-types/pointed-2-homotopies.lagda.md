## Idea

Consider two [pointed homotopies](structured-types.pointed-homotopies.md)
`H := (H₀ , H₁)` and `K := (K₀ , K₁)` between two
[pointed dependent functions](structured-types.pointed-dependent-functions.md)
`f := (f₀ , f₁)` and `g := (g₀ , g₁)` with base point coherences

```text
        H₀ *                        H₀ *
  f₀ * ------> g₀ *           f₀ * ------> g₀ *
      \       /                   \       ∧
    f₁ \  H₁ / g₁      and      f₁ \  H̃₁ / inv g₁
        \   /                       \   /
         ∨ ∨                         ∨ /
          *                           *
```

and

```text
        K₀ *                        K₀ *
  f₀ * ------> g₀ *           f₀ * ------> g₀ *
      \       /                   \       ∧
    f₁ \  K₁ / g₁      and      f₁ \  K̃₁ / inv g₁
        \   /                       \   /
         ∨ ∨                         ∨ /
          *                           *,
```

where

```text
  H̃₁ := coherence-triangle-inv-right f₁ g₁ (H₀ *) H₁
  K̃₁ := coherence-triangle-inv-right f₁ g₁ (K₀ *) K₁
```

A {{#concept "pointed `2`-homotopy" Agda=_~²∗_}} `H ~²∗ K` then consists of an
unpointed [homotopy](foundation-core.homotopies.md) `α₀ : H₀ ~ K₀` and an
[identification](foundation-core.identity-types.md) witnessing that the triangle

```text
        H₁
  f₁ ------> (H₀ *) ∙ g₁
    \       /
  K₁ \     / right-whisker-concat (α₀ *) g₁
      \   /
       ∨ ∨
   (K₀ *) ∙ g₁
```

[commutes](foundation.commuting-triangles-of-identifications.md). Equivalently,
following the [equivalence](foundation-core.equivalences.md) of pointed
homotopies and
[uniform pointed homotopies](structured-types.uniform-pointed-homotopies.md), a
uniform pointed `2`-homotopy consists of an unpointed homotopy `α₀ : H₀ ~ K₀`
and an identification witnessing that `α₀` preserves the base point, i.e.,
witnessing that the triangle

```text
        α₀ *
  H₀ * ------> K₀ *
      \       ∧
    H̃₁ \     / inv K̃₁
        \   /
         ∨ /
       f₁ ∙ inv g₁
```

commutes. Note that such identifications are often much harder to construct. Our
preferred definition of pointed `2`-homotopies is therefore the non-uniform
definition described first.

### The reflexive pointed `2`-homotopy

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} {A : Pointed-Type l1} {B : Pointed-Fam l2 A}
  {f g : pointed-Π A B} (H : f ~∗ g)
  where

  htpy-refl-pointed-2-htpy : unpointed-htpy-pointed-htpy H H
  htpy-refl-pointed-2-htpy = refl-htpy

  coherence-point-refl-pointed-2-htpy :
    coherence-point-unpointed-htpy-pointed-htpy H H
      ( htpy-refl-pointed-2-htpy)
  coherence-point-refl-pointed-2-htpy = inv right-unit

  refl-pointed-2-htpy : H ~²∗ H
  pr1 refl-pointed-2-htpy = htpy-refl-pointed-2-htpy
  pr2 refl-pointed-2-htpy = coherence-point-refl-pointed-2-htpy
```

### Concatenation of pointed `2`-homotopies

Consider two pointed dependent functions `f := (f₀ , f₁)` and `g := (g₀ , g₁)`
and three pointed homotopies `H := (H₀ , H₁)`, `K := (K₀ , K₁)`, and
`L := (L₀ , L₁)` between them. Furthermore, consider two pointed `2`-homotopies
`α := (α₀ , α₁) : H ~²∗ K` and `β := (β₀ , β₁) : K ~²∗ L`. The underlying
homotopy of the concatenation `α ∙h β` is simply the concatenation of homotopies

```text
  (α ∙h β)₀ := α₀ ∙h β₀.
```

The base point coherence `(α ∙h β)₁` is an identification witnessing that the
triangle

```text
        H₁
  f₁ ------> (H₀ *) ∙ h₁
    \       /
  L₁ \     / right-whisker-concat ((α₀ *) ∙h (β₀ *)) g₁
      \   /
       ∨ ∨
   (L₀ *) ∙ h₁
```

commutes. Note that right whiskering of identifications with respect to
concatenation distributes over concatenation. The identification witnessing the
commutativity of the above triangle can therefore be constructed by constructing
an identification witnessing that the triangle

```text
           H₁
  f₁ ----------> (H₀ *) ∙ h₁
    \             /
     \           / right-whisker-concat (α₀ *) g₁
      \         ∨
    L₁ \    (K₀ *) ∙ h₁
        \     /
         \   / right-whisker-concat (β₀ *) g₁
          ∨ ∨
      (L₀ *) ∙ h₁
```

commutes. This triangle commutes by right pasting of commuting triangles of
identifications.

## Properties

### Extensionality of pointed homotopies

Pointed `2`-homotopies characterize identifications of pointed homotopies.

Associativity of concatenation of three pointed homotopies `G`, `H`, and `K` is
a pointed `2`-homotopy

```text
  (G ∙h H) ∙h K ~²∗ G ∙h (H ∙h K).
```

### The left unit law of concatenation of pointed homotopies

Consider a pointed homotopy `H := (H₀ , H₁)` between pointed dependent functions
`f := (f₀ , f₁)` and `g := (g₀ , g₁)`. Then there is a pointed `2`-homotopy of
type

```text
  refl-pointed-htpy ∙h H ~²∗ H.
```

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} {A : Pointed-Type l1} {B : Pointed-Fam l2 A}
  {f g : pointed-Π A B} (H : f ~∗ g)
  where

    unpointed-htpy-pointed-htpy
      ( concat-pointed-htpy (refl-pointed-htpy f) H)
      ( H)
  htpy-left-unit-law-concat-pointed-htpy = refl-htpy

    coherence-point-unpointed-htpy-pointed-htpy
      ( concat-pointed-htpy (refl-pointed-htpy f) H)

      ( htpy-left-unit-law-concat-pointed-htpy)
  coherence-point-left-unit-law-concat-pointed-htpy =
    inv (right-unit ∙ right-unit ∙ ap-id (coherence-point-pointed-htpy H))

  left-unit-law-concat-pointed-htpy :
    concat-pointed-htpy (refl-pointed-htpy f) H ~²∗ H
  pr1 left-unit-law-concat-pointed-htpy =
    htpy-left-unit-law-concat-pointed-htpy
  pr2 left-unit-law-concat-pointed-htpy =
    coherence-point-left-unit-law-concat-pointed-htpy
```

### The right unit law of concatenation of pointed homotopies

Consider a pointed homotopy `H := (H₀ , H₁)` between pointed dependent functions
`f := (f₀ , f₁)` and `g := (g₀ , g₁)`. Then there is a pointed `2`-homotopy

```text
  H ∙h refl-pointed-htpy ~²∗ H.
```

The underlying homotopy of this pointed `2`-homotopy is the homotopy
`right-unit-htpy`. The base point coherence of this homotopy is an
identification witnessing that the triangle

```text
     (H ∙h refl)₁
  f₁ ------------> (H₀ * ∙ refl) ∙ g₁

commutes. Here, the identification `(H ∙h refl)₁` is the horizontal pasting of
commuting triangles of identifications

```text
      H₀ *      refl
  f₀ * --> g₀ * ---> g₀ *
      \      |      /
       \     | g₁  /
     f₁ \    |    / g₁
         \   |   /
          \  |  /
           ∨ ∨ ∨
             *.
```

The upper triangle therefore commutes by the right unit law of horizontal
pasting of commuting triangles of identifications.
