## Idea

We show that ℤ is the initial pointed type equipped with an automorphism

## Definition

### The type of integers is the intial type equipped with a point and an automorphism

#### The type of integers is a type equipped with a point and an automorphism

```agda
ℤ-Pointed-Type-With-Aut : Pointed-Type-With-Aut lzero
pr1 (pr1 ℤ-Pointed-Type-With-Aut) = ℤ
pr2 (pr1 ℤ-Pointed-Type-With-Aut) = zero-ℤ
pr2 ℤ-Pointed-Type-With-Aut = equiv-succ-ℤ
```

#### Construction of a map from ℤ into any type with a point and an automorphism
