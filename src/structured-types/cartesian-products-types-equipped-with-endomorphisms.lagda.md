## Idea

The **cartesian product** of two
[types equipped with an endomorphism](structured-types.types-equipped-with-endomorphisms.md)
`(A , f)` and `(B , g)` is defined as `(A × B , f × g)`

## Definitions

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level}
  (A : Type-With-Endomorphism l1) (B : Type-With-Endomorphism l2)
  where

  type-product-Type-With-Endomorphism : UU (l1 ⊔ l2)
  type-product-Type-With-Endomorphism =
    type-Type-With-Endomorphism A × type-Type-With-Endomorphism B

  endomorphism-product-Type-With-Endomorphism :
    type-product-Type-With-Endomorphism → type-product-Type-With-Endomorphism
  endomorphism-product-Type-With-Endomorphism =
    map-product
      ( endomorphism-Type-With-Endomorphism A)
      ( endomorphism-Type-With-Endomorphism B)

  product-Type-With-Endomorphism :
    Type-With-Endomorphism (l1 ⊔ l2)
  pr1 product-Type-With-Endomorphism =
    type-product-Type-With-Endomorphism
  pr2 product-Type-With-Endomorphism =
    endomorphism-product-Type-With-Endomorphism
```
