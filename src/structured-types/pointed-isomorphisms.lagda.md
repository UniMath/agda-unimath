## Idea

A {{#concept "pointed isomorphism" Agda=pointed-iso}} is an isomorphism in the
wild category of pointed types, i.e., it is a
[pointed map](structured-types.pointed-types.md) equipped with a
[pointed section](structured-types.pointed-sections.md) and a
[pointed retraction](structured-types.pointed-retractions.md).
