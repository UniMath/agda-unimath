## Idea

The [whiskering operations](foundation.whiskering-operations.md) of
[pointed `2`-homotopies](structured-types.pointed-2-homotopies.md) with respect
to concatenation of [pointed homotopies](structured-types.pointed-homotopies.md)
are two operations that produce pointed 2-homotopies between concatenations of
pointed homotopies from either a pointed 2-homotopy on the left or on the right
of the concatenations.

- The
  {{#concept "left whiskering" Disambiguation="pointed `2`-homotopies with respect to concatenation" Agda=left-whisker-concat-pointed-2-htpy}}
  is an operation that takes a pointed homotopy `H : f ~∗ g` and a pointed
  `2`-homotopy `α : K ~²∗ L` between two pointed homotopies `K L : g ~∗ h` as
  indicated in the diagram

  ```text
                 K
        H      ----->
    f -----> g -----> h,
                 L
  ```

  and returns a pointed `2`-homotopy `H ∙h K ~²∗ H ∙h L`.

- The
  {{#concept "right whiskering" Disambiguation="pointed `2`-homotopies with respect to concatenation" Agda=right-whisker-concat-pointed-2-htpy}}
  is an operation that takes a pointed `2`-homotopy `α : H ~²∗ K` between two
  pointed homotopies `H K : f ~∗ g` and a pointed homotopy `L : g ~∗ h` as
  indicated in the diagram

  ```text
        H
      ----->
    f -----> g -----> h,
        K        L
  ```

  and returns a pointed `2`-homotopy `H ∙h L ~²∗ K ∙h L`.

## Definitions

### Left whiskering of pointed `2`-homotopies with respect to concatenation

Consider three pointed maps `f := (f₀ , f₁)`, `g := (g₀ , g₁)`, and
`h := (h₀ , h₁)` from `A` to `B`, a pointed homotopy `H := (H₀ , H₁) : f ~∗ g`
and a pointed `2`-homotopy `α := (α₀ , α₁) : K ~²∗ L` between two pointed
homotopies `K := (K₀ , K₁)` and `L := (L₀ , L₁)` from `g` to `h` as indicated in
the diagram

```text
               K
      H      ----->
  f -----> g -----> h.
               L
```

The underlying homotopy of the left whiskering `H ·l∗ α : H ∙h K ~²∗ H ∙h L` is
the homotopy

```text
  H₀ ·l α₀ : H₀ ∙h K₀ ~ H₀ ∙h L₀.
```

The base point coherence of this homotopy is an identification witnessing that
the triangle

```text
           (H ∙h K)₁
        f₁ --------> ((H₀ *) ∙ (K₀ *)) ∙ h₁
           \       /
  (H ∙h L)₁ \     / right-whisker (left-whisker (H₀ *) (α₀ *)) h₁
             \   /
              ∨ ∨
    ((H₀ *) ∙ (L₀ *)) ∙ h₁
```

commutes. Here, the identifications `(H ∙h K)₁` and `(H ∙h L)₁` are the
horizontal pastings of the
[commuting triangles of identifications](foundation.commuting-triangles-of-identifications.md)

```text
       H₀ *      K₀ *                   H₀ *      L₀ *
  f₀ * ---> g₀ * ----> h₀ *        f₀ * ---> g₀ * ----> h₀ *
       \      |      /                  \      |      /
        \  H₁ |  K₁ /                    \  H₁ |  L₁ /
     f₁  \    |g₁  / h₁               f₁  \    |g₁  / h₁
          \   |   /                        \   |   /
           \  |  /                          \  |  /
            ∨ ∨ ∨                            ∨ ∨ ∨
              *                                *.
```

Then the triangle

```text
                   horizontal-pasting H₁ K₁
                       f₁ --------> (H₀ * ∙ K₀ *) ∙ h₁
                         \         /
                          \       /
  horizontal-pasting H₁ L₁ \     / right-whisker (left-whisker (H₀ *) (α₀ *)) h₁
                            \   /
                             ∨ ∨
                        (H₀ * ∙ K₀ *) ∙ h₁
```

commutes by left whiskering of horizontal pasting of commuting triangles of
identifications.

### Right whiskering of pointed `2`-homotopies with respect to concatenation

Consider three pointed maps `f := (f₀ , f₁)`, `g := (g₀ , g₁)`, and
`h := (h₀ , h₁)` from `A` to `B`, a pointed `2`-homotopy
`α := (α₀ , α₁) : H ~²∗ K` between two pointed homotopies `H := (H₀ , H₁)` and
`K := (K₀ , K₁)` from `f` to `g` and a pointed homotopy
`L := (L₀ , L₁) : g ~∗ h` as indicated in the diagram

```text
      H
    ----->
  f -----> g -----> h.
      K        L
```

The underlying homotopy of the right whiskering `α ·r∗ L : H ∙h L ~²∗ K ∙h L` is
the homotopy

```text
  α₀ ·r L₀ : H₀ ∙h L₀ ~ K₀ ∙h L₀.
```

The base point coherence of this homotopy is an identification witnessing that
the triangle

```text
           (H ∙h L)₁
         f₁ --------> ((H₀ *) ∙ (L₀ *)) ∙ h₁
           \         /
  (K ∙h L)₁ \       / right-whisker (right-whisker (α₀ *) (L₀ *)) h₁
             \     /
              ∨   ∨
      ((K₀ *) ∙ (L₀ *)) ∙ h₁
```

commutes. Here, the identifications `(H ∙h L)₁` and `(K ∙h L)₁` are the
horizontal pastings of the
[commuting triangles of identifications](foundation.commuting-triangles-of-identifications.md)

```text
       H₀ *      L₀ *                   K₀ *      L₀ *

       \      |      /                  \      |      /
        \  H₁ |  L₁ /                    \  K₁ |  L₁ /

              *                                *.
```

Then the triangle

```text
                   horizontal-pasting H₁ L₁
                       f₁ --------> (H₀ * ∙ L₀ *) ∙ h₁
