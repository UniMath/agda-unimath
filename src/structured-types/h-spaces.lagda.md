## Idea

A **(coherent) H-space** is a "wild unital magma", i.e., it is a
[pointed type](structured-types.pointed-types.md)
[equipped](foundation.structure.md) with a binary operation for which the base
point is a unit, with a coherence law between the left and the right unit laws.

## Definitions

### Unital binary operations on pointed types

```agda
coherent-unit-laws-mul-Pointed-Type :
  {l : Level} (A : Pointed-Type l)
  (μ : (x y : type-Pointed-Type A) → type-Pointed-Type A) → UU l
coherent-unit-laws-mul-Pointed-Type A μ =
  coherent-unit-laws μ (point-Pointed-Type A)

coherent-unital-mul-Pointed-Type :
  {l : Level} → Pointed-Type l → UU l
coherent-unital-mul-Pointed-Type A =
  Σ ( type-Pointed-Type A → type-Pointed-Type A → type-Pointed-Type A)
    ( coherent-unit-laws-mul-Pointed-Type A)
```

### H-spaces

An H-space consists of a pointed type `X` and a coherent unital multiplication
on `X`. The entry `make-H-Space` is provided to break up the construction of an
H-space into two components: the construction of its underlying pointed type and
the construction of the coherently unital multiplication on this pointed type.
Furthermore, this definition suggests that any construction of an H-space should
be refactored by first defining its underlying pointed type, then defining its
coherently unital multiplication, and finally combining those two constructions
using `make-H-Space`.

```agda
H-Space : (l : Level) → UU (lsuc l)
H-Space l =
  Σ ( Pointed-Type l) coherent-unital-mul-Pointed-Type

make-H-Space :
  {l : Level} →
  (X : Pointed-Type l) → coherent-unital-mul-Pointed-Type X → H-Space l
make-H-Space X μ = (X , μ)

{-# INLINE make-H-Space #-}

module _
  {l : Level} (M : H-Space l)
  where

  pointed-type-H-Space : Pointed-Type l
  pointed-type-H-Space = pr1 M

  type-H-Space : UU l
  type-H-Space = type-Pointed-Type pointed-type-H-Space

  coherent-unital-mul-H-Space = pr2 M

  mul-H-Space :
    type-H-Space → type-H-Space → type-H-Space
  mul-H-Space = pr1 coherent-unital-mul-H-Space

  mul-H-Space' :
    type-H-Space → type-H-Space → type-H-Space
  mul-H-Space' x y = mul-H-Space y x

  ap-mul-H-Space :
    {a b c d : type-H-Space} → Id a b → Id c d →
    Id (mul-H-Space a c) (mul-H-Space b d)
  ap-mul-H-Space p q = ap-binary mul-H-Space p q

  magma-H-Space : Magma l

  left-unit-law-mul-H-Space =
    pr1 coherent-unit-laws-mul-H-Space

## Properties

### Every noncoherent H-space can be upgraded to a coherent H-space

```agda
h-space-Noncoherent-H-Space :
  {l : Level} → Noncoherent-H-Space l → H-Space l
pr1 (h-space-Noncoherent-H-Space A) = pointed-type-Noncoherent-H-Space A
pr1 (pr2 (h-space-Noncoherent-H-Space A)) = mul-Noncoherent-H-Space A
pr2 (pr2 (h-space-Noncoherent-H-Space A)) =
  coherent-unit-laws-unit-laws
    ( mul-Noncoherent-H-Space A)
    ( unit-laws-mul-Noncoherent-H-Space A)
```

### The type of H-space structures on `A` is equivalent to the type of sections of `ev-point : (A → A) →∗ A`

```agda
module _
  {l : Level} (A : Pointed-Type l)
  where

  ev-endo-Pointed-Type : endo-Pointed-Type (type-Pointed-Type A) →∗ A
  pr1 ev-endo-Pointed-Type = ev-point-Pointed-Type A
  pr2 ev-endo-Pointed-Type = refl

  pointed-section-ev-point-Pointed-Type : UU l
  pointed-section-ev-point-Pointed-Type =
    pointed-section ev-endo-Pointed-Type

  compute-pointed-section-ev-point-Pointed-Type :
    pointed-section-ev-point-Pointed-Type ≃ coherent-unital-mul-Pointed-Type A
  compute-pointed-section-ev-point-Pointed-Type =
    ( equiv-tot
      ( λ _ →
        equiv-Σ _
          ( equiv-funext)
          ( λ _ →
            equiv-tot (λ _ → inv-equiv (equiv-right-whisker-concat refl))))) ∘e
    ( associative-Σ _ _ _)
```
