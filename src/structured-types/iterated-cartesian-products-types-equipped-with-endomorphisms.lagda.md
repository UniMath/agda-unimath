## Idea

From a list of a types equipped with endomorphisms, we define its iterated
cartesian product recursively via the cartesian product of types equipped with
endomorphism.

## Definitions

```agda
iterated-product-list-Type-With-Endomorphism :
  {l : Level} → list (Type-With-Endomorphism l) → Type-With-Endomorphism l
iterated-product-list-Type-With-Endomorphism nil =
  trivial-Type-With-Endomorphism
iterated-product-list-Type-With-Endomorphism (cons A L) =
  product-Type-With-Endomorphism A
    ( iterated-product-list-Type-With-Endomorphism L)
```
