## Idea

Consider an [∞-group](higher-group-theory.higher-groups.md) `G` and an
[∞-group action](higher-group-theory.higher-group-actions.md) of `G` on `X`. We
say that `X` is **transitive** if its type of
[orbits](higher-group-theory.orbits-higher-group-actions.md) is
[connected](foundation.connected-types.md).

[Equivalently](foundation.logical-equivalences.md), we say that `X` is
**abstractly transitive** if the underlying type of `X` is
[inhabited](foundation.inhabited-types.md) and for any element `x : X (sh G)` of
the underlying type of `X` the action map

```text
  g ↦ mul-action-∞-Group G X g x
```

is [surjective](foundation.surjective-maps.md). The equivalence of these two
conditions is established via the
[Regensburg extension of the fundamental theorem of identity types](foundation.regensburg-extension-fundamental-theorem-of-identity-types.md).

Note that it is necessary to include the condition that `X` is inhabited in the
condition that `G` acts transitively on `X`. A first reason is that this makes
the condition of being abstractly transitive equivalent to the condition of
being transitive. A second reason is that this way we will be able to recover
the familiar property that a `G`-action `X` is a `G`-torsor if and only if it is
both [free](higher-group-theory.free-higher-group-actions.md) and transitive.

## Properties

### If an action is abstractly transitive, then transport is surjective

```agda
