## Idea

One may wonder if the notion of [cyclic group](group-theory.cyclic-groups.md)
generalizes to [higher groups](higher-group-theory.higher-groups.md). A naive
way of defining cyclic higher groups is to extend the universal property of
cyclic groups to all higher groups. Following this idea, we say that a higher
group `G` is **cyclic** if there
[exists](foundation.existential-quantification.md) an element `g` of `G` such
that the evaluation map

```text
  hom-∞-Group G H → type-∞-Group H
```

given by `f ↦ map-hom-∞-Group G H f g` is an
[embedding](foundation.embeddings.md) for every higher group `H`. In other
words, a higher group is cyclic if it is generated by a single element.

However, by Miller's theorem {{#cite Mil84}} we don't expect there to be many
higher groups that are cyclic in this sense. For example, the finite cyclic
groups `Bℤ/n` are coherent spaces, whereas the 2-sphere `S²` is a finite
CW-complex. Miller's theorem implies that the pointed mapping space
`Map∗(Bℤ/n,S²)` is contractible. However, this implies that the evaluation map
`Map∗(Bℤ/n,S²) → ΩS²` at the generator of `ℤ/n` is a point inclusion into a
nondiscrete type, so it can't be an embedding.

## Definitions

### Cyclic higher groups

```agda
ev-element-∞-Group :
  {l1 l2 : Level} (G : ∞-Group l1) (H : ∞-Group l2) (g : type-∞-Group G) →
  hom-∞-Group G H → type-∞-Group H
ev-element-∞-Group G H g f = map-hom-∞-Group G H f g

module _
  {l1 : Level} (l2 : Level) (G : ∞-Group l1)
  where

  is-cyclic-prop-∞-Group : Prop (l1 ⊔ lsuc l2)
  is-cyclic-prop-∞-Group =
    exists-structure-Prop
      ( type-∞-Group G)
      ( λ g → (H : ∞-Group l2) → is-emb (ev-element-∞-Group G H g))

  is-cyclic-∞-Group : UU (l1 ⊔ lsuc l2)
  is-cyclic-∞-Group = type-Prop is-cyclic-prop-∞-Group

  is-prop-is-cyclic-∞-Group : is-prop is-cyclic-∞-Group
  is-prop-is-cyclic-∞-Group = is-prop-type-Prop is-cyclic-prop-∞-Group
```
