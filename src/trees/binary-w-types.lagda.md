## Idea

Consider a type `A` and two type families `B` and `C` over `A`. Then we obtain
the [polynomial functor](trees.multivariable-polynomial-functors.md)

```text
  X Y ↦ Σ (a : A), (B a → X) × (C a → Y)
```

in two variables `X` and `Y`. By diagonalising, we obtain the
[polynomial endofunctor](trees.polynomial-endofunctors.md)

```text
  X ↦ Σ (a : A), (B a → X) × (C a → X).
```

which may be brought to the exact form of a polynomial endofunctor if one wishes
to do so:

```text
  X ↦ Σ (a : A), (B a + C a → X).
```

The {{#concept "binary W-type" Agda=binary-𝕎}} is the W-type `binary-𝕎`
associated to this polynomial endofunctor. In other words, it is the inductive
type generated by

```text
  make-binary-𝕎 : (a : A) → (B a → binary-𝕎) → (C a → binary-𝕎) → binary-𝕎.
```

The binary W-type is equivalent to the
[hereditary W-types](trees.hereditary-w-types.md) via an
[equivalence](foundation.equivalences.md) that generalizes the equivalence of
plane trees and full binary plane trees, which is a well known equivalence used
in the study of the
[Catalan numbers](elementary-number-theory.catalan-numbers.md).

## Definitions

### Binary W-types

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 l3 : Level} {A : UU l1} (B : A → UU l2) (C : A → UU l3)
  where

  data binary-𝕎 : UU (l1 ⊔ l2 ⊔ l3) where
    make-binary-𝕎 :
      (a : A) → (B a → binary-𝕎) → (C a → binary-𝕎) → binary-𝕎
```
