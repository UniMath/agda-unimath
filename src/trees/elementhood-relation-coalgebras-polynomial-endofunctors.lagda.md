## Idea

Given two elements `x y : X` in the underlying type of a coalgebra of a
polynomial endofunctor, We say that **`x` is an element of `y`**, i.e., `x ∈ y`,
if there is an element `b : B (shape y)` equipped with an identification
`component y b ＝ x`. Note that this elementhood relation of an arbitrary
coalgebra need not be irreflexive.

By the elementhood relation on coalgebras we obtain for each coalgebra a
directed graph.
