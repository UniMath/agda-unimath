## Idea

Consider a type `A` and a type family `B` over `A`. An **`(A,B)`-enriched
directed tree** is a directed tree `T` equipped with a map

```text
  shape : node-Directed-Tree T → A
```

and for each node `x` an equivalence

```text
  e : B (shape x) ≃ Σ (node-Directed-Tree T) (λ y → edge-Directed-Tree T y x)
```

By this equivalence, there is a higher group action of `Ω (A , f x)` on the type
of children of `x`.
