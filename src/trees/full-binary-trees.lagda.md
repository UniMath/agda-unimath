## Idea

A
{{#concept "full binary tree" Agda=full-binary-tree WD="full binary tree" WDID=Q29791667}}
is a finite [directed tree](trees.directed-trees.md) in which every non-leaf
node has a specified left branch and a specified right branch. More precisely, a
full binary tree consists of a root, a left full binary subtree and a right full
binary subtree.
