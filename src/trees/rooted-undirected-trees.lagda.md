## Idea

A **rooted undirected tree** is a tree equipped with a marked node. The marked
node is called the **root** of the undirected tree.

## Definition

```agda
Rooted-Undirected-Tree : (l1 l2 : Level) → UU (lsuc l1 ⊔ lsuc l2)
Rooted-Undirected-Tree l1 l2 = Σ (Undirected-Tree l1 l2) node-Undirected-Tree

module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} (T : Rooted-Undirected-Tree l1 l2)
  where

  tree-Rooted-Undirected-Tree : Undirected-Tree l1 l2
  tree-Rooted-Undirected-Tree = pr1 T

  undirected-graph-Rooted-Undirected-Tree : Undirected-Graph l1 l2
  undirected-graph-Rooted-Undirected-Tree =
    undirected-graph-Undirected-Tree tree-Rooted-Undirected-Tree

  node-Rooted-Undirected-Tree : UU l1
  node-Rooted-Undirected-Tree = node-Undirected-Tree tree-Rooted-Undirected-Tree

  root-Rooted-Undirected-Tree : node-Rooted-Undirected-Tree
  root-Rooted-Undirected-Tree = pr2 T

  trail-to-root-Rooted-Undirected-Tree :
    (x : node-Rooted-Undirected-Tree) →
    trail-Undirected-Graph undirected-graph-Rooted-Undirected-Tree x
      root-Rooted-Undirected-Tree
  trail-to-root-Rooted-Undirected-Tree x =
    standard-trail-Undirected-Tree
      ( tree-Rooted-Undirected-Tree)
      ( x)
      ( root-Rooted-Undirected-Tree)

  height-node-Rooted-Undirected-Tree : node-Rooted-Undirected-Tree → ℕ
  height-node-Rooted-Undirected-Tree x =
    length-trail-Undirected-Graph
      ( undirected-graph-Rooted-Undirected-Tree)
      ( trail-to-root-Rooted-Undirected-Tree x)

  node-of-height-one-Rooted-Undirected-Tree : UU l1
  node-of-height-one-Rooted-Undirected-Tree =
    Σ ( node-Rooted-Undirected-Tree)
      ( λ x → is-one-ℕ (height-node-Rooted-Undirected-Tree x))
```

## Properties

### The type of rooted trees is equivalent to the type of forests of rooted trees

```agda
Forest-Rooted-Undirected-Trees :
  (l1 l2 l3 : Level) → UU (lsuc l1 ⊔ lsuc l2 ⊔ lsuc l3)
Forest-Rooted-Undirected-Trees l1 l2 l3 =
  Σ (UU l1) (λ X → X → Rooted-Undirected-Tree l2 l3)

module _
  {l1 l2 l3 : Level} (F : Forest-Rooted-Undirected-Trees l1 l2 l3)
  where

  indexing-type-Forest-Rooted-Undirected-Trees : UU l1
  indexing-type-Forest-Rooted-Undirected-Trees = pr1 F

  family-of-rooted-trees-Forest-Rooted-Undirected-Trees :
    indexing-type-Forest-Rooted-Undirected-Trees → Rooted-Undirected-Tree l2 l3
  family-of-rooted-trees-Forest-Rooted-Undirected-Trees = pr2 F

  node-rooted-tree-Forest-Rooted-Undirected-Trees : UU (l1 ⊔ l2)
  node-rooted-tree-Forest-Rooted-Undirected-Trees =
    ( Σ indexing-type-Forest-Rooted-Undirected-Trees
      ( λ x →
        node-Rooted-Undirected-Tree
          ( family-of-rooted-trees-Forest-Rooted-Undirected-Trees x))) +
    ( unit)

  unordered-pair-of-nodes-rooted-tree-Forest-Rooted-Undirected-Trees :
    UU (lsuc lzero ⊔ l1 ⊔ l2)
  unordered-pair-of-nodes-rooted-tree-Forest-Rooted-Undirected-Trees =
