## Idea

Using the fibers of base elements, the type of enriched directed trees has the
structure of a coalgebra for the polynomial endofunctor

```text
  X ↦ Σ (a : A), B a → X.
```

## Definition

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} (l3 : Level) (A : UU l1) (B : A → UU l2)
  where

  structure-coalgebra-Enriched-Directed-Tree :
    Enriched-Directed-Tree l3 l3 A B →
    type-polynomial-endofunctor A B (Enriched-Directed-Tree l3 l3 A B)
  pr1 (structure-coalgebra-Enriched-Directed-Tree T) =
    shape-root-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T
  pr2 (structure-coalgebra-Enriched-Directed-Tree T) =
    fiber-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T

  coalgebra-Enriched-Directed-Tree :
    coalgebra-polynomial-endofunctor (l1 ⊔ l2 ⊔ lsuc l3) A B
  pr1 coalgebra-Enriched-Directed-Tree = Enriched-Directed-Tree l3 l3 A B
  pr2 coalgebra-Enriched-Directed-Tree =
    structure-coalgebra-Enriched-Directed-Tree
