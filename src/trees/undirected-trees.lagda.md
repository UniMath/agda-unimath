## Idea

An **undirected tree** is an undirected graph such that the type of trails from
x to y is contractible for any two vertices x and y.

### Distance between nodes of a tree

```agda
  dist-Undirected-Tree : node-Undirected-Tree → node-Undirected-Tree → ℕ
  dist-Undirected-Tree x y =
    length-trail-Undirected-Tree (standard-trail-Undirected-Tree x y)
```

## Properties

### Trees are acyclic graphs

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} (T : Undirected-Tree l1 l2)
  where

  is-refl-is-circuit-walk-Undirected-Tree :
    {x y : node-Undirected-Tree T} (t : trail-Undirected-Tree T x y)
    (p : x ＝ y) →
    tr (walk-Undirected-Tree T x) p refl-walk-Undirected-Graph ＝
    walk-trail-Undirected-Tree T t
  is-refl-is-circuit-walk-Undirected-Tree {x} t refl =
    ap
      ( walk-trail-Undirected-Tree T)
      ( eq-is-contr
        ( is-tree-undirected-graph-Undirected-Tree T x x)
        { pair
          ( refl-walk-Undirected-Graph)
          ( is-trail-refl-walk-Undirected-Graph
            ( undirected-graph-Undirected-Tree T) {x})}
        { t})

  is-empty-edge-on-walk-is-circuit-walk-Undirected-Tree :

    (p : x ＝ y) → is-empty (edge-on-trail-Undirected-Tree T t)
  is-empty-edge-on-walk-is-circuit-walk-Undirected-Tree {x} t refl e =

        ( inv (is-refl-is-circuit-walk-Undirected-Tree t refl))
        ( e))
```

### If `x` and `y` are merely equal vertices, then the standard trail between them is constant

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} (T : Undirected-Tree l1 l2) {x : node-Undirected-Tree T}
  where

  is-constant-standard-trail-eq-Undirected-Tree :

        ( is-refl-is-circuit-walk-Undirected-Tree T
        ( standard-trail-Undirected-Tree T x y)
        ( refl)))

    {y : node-Undirected-Tree T} →

  is-constant-standard-trail-mere-eq-Undirected-Tree {y} H =
    apply-universal-property-trunc-Prop H
      ( is-constant-trail-Undirected-Tree-Prop T
        ( standard-trail-Undirected-Tree T x y))
      ( is-constant-standard-trail-eq-Undirected-Tree)

  eq-is-constant-standard-trail-Undirected-Tree :
    {y : node-Undirected-Tree T} →
    is-constant-trail-Undirected-Tree T (standard-trail-Undirected-Tree T x y) →
    x ＝ y
  eq-is-constant-standard-trail-Undirected-Tree {y} H =
    eq-constant-walk-Undirected-Graph
      ( undirected-graph-Undirected-Tree T)
      ( pair (standard-walk-Undirected-Tree T x y) H)
```

### The type of nodes of a tree is a set

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} (T : Undirected-Tree l1 l2) {x : node-Undirected-Tree T}
  where

  is-set-node-Undirected-Tree : is-set (node-Undirected-Tree T)
  is-set-node-Undirected-Tree =
    is-set-mere-eq-in-id
      ( λ x y H →
        eq-constant-walk-Undirected-Graph
          ( undirected-graph-Undirected-Tree T)
          ( pair
            ( standard-walk-Undirected-Tree T x y)
            ( is-constant-standard-trail-mere-eq-Undirected-Tree T H)))

  node-Undirected-Tree-Set : Set l1
  pr1 node-Undirected-Tree-Set = node-Undirected-Tree T
  pr2 node-Undirected-Tree-Set = is-set-node-Undirected-Tree
```

### The type of nodes of a tree has decidable equality

```agda
has-decidable-equality-node-Undirected-Tree :
  {l1 l2 : Level} (T : Undirected-Tree l2 l1) →
  has-decidable-equality (node-Undirected-Tree T)
has-decidable-equality-node-Undirected-Tree T x y =
  is-decidable-iff
    ( eq-is-constant-standard-trail-Undirected-Tree T)
    ( is-constant-standard-trail-eq-Undirected-Tree T)
    ( is-decidable-is-constant-trail-Undirected-Tree T
      ( standard-trail-Undirected-Tree T x y))
```

### Any trail in a tree is a path

There are many variations of the notion of trees, all of which are subtly
different:

- Directed trees can be found in
  [`trees.directed-trees`](trees.directed-trees.md).
- Acyclic undirected graphs can be found in
  [`graph-theory.acyclic-undirected-graphs`](graph-theory.acyclic-undirected-graphs.md).
