## Idea

The **base** of an enriched directed tree consists of its nodes equipped with an
edge to the root.

## Definition

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 l3 l4 : Level} (A : UU l1) (B : A → UU l2)
  (T : Enriched-Directed-Tree l3 l4 A B)
  where

  base-Enriched-Directed-Tree : UU l2
  base-Enriched-Directed-Tree = B (shape-root-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T)

  compute-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree :
    base-Enriched-Directed-Tree ≃
    direct-predecessor-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T
      ( root-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T)
  compute-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree =
    enrichment-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T (root-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T)

  map-compute-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree :
    base-Enriched-Directed-Tree →
    direct-predecessor-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T
      ( root-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T)
  map-compute-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree =
    map-enrichment-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T
      ( root-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T)

  module _
    (b : base-Enriched-Directed-Tree)
    where

    node-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree : node-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T
    node-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree =
      node-base-Directed-Tree
        ( directed-tree-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T)
        ( map-compute-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree b)

    edge-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree :
      edge-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T
        ( node-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree)
        ( root-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T)
    edge-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree =
      edge-base-Directed-Tree
        ( directed-tree-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T)
        ( map-compute-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree b)
```

## Properties

### The root is not a base element

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 l3 l4 : Level} (A : UU l1) (B : A → UU l2)
  (T : Enriched-Directed-Tree l3 l4 A B)
  where

  is-proper-node-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree :
    (b : base-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T) →
    is-proper-node-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T
      ( node-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T b)
  is-proper-node-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree b =
    is-proper-node-base-Directed-Tree
      ( directed-tree-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T)
      ( map-compute-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T b)

  no-walk-to-base-root-Enriched-Directed-Tree :
    (b : base-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T) →
    ¬ ( walk-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T
        ( root-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T)
        ( node-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T b))
  no-walk-to-base-root-Enriched-Directed-Tree b =
    no-walk-to-base-root-Directed-Tree
      ( directed-tree-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T)
      ( map-compute-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T b)
```

### There are no edges between base elements

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 l3 l4 : Level} (A : UU l1) (B : A → UU l2)
  (T : Enriched-Directed-Tree l3 l4 A B)
  where

  no-edge-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree :
    (a b : base-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T) →
    ¬ ( edge-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T
        ( node-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T a)
        ( node-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T b))
  no-edge-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree a b =
    no-edge-base-Directed-Tree
      ( directed-tree-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T)
      ( map-compute-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T a)
      ( map-compute-base-Enriched-Directed-Tree A B T b)
```

### For any node `x`, the coproduct of `is-root x` and the type of base elements `b` equipped with a walk from `x` to `b` is contractible
