## Idea

Let `S` be a function from the type of commutative finite rings to the finite
types that preserves cartesian products. The **Hasse-Weil species** is a species
of finite inhabited types defined for any finite inhabited type `k` as

Σ (p : structure-semisimple-commutative-ring-Finite-Type k) ; S (commutative-finite-ring-finite-semisimple-commutative-ring-structure-semisimple-commutative-ring-Finite-Type k p)
```
