## Idea

In classical mathematics, the Dirichlet series of a species of finite inhabited
types `T` is the formal series in `s` :

```text
Σ (n : ℕ∖{0}) (|T({1,...,n}| n^(-s) / n!))
```

If `s` is a negative integer, the categorified version of this formula is

```text
Σ (F : Finite-Type ∖ {∅}), T (F) × (S → F)
```

We can generalize it to species of types as

```text
Σ (U : UU) (T (U) × (S → U))
```

The interesting case is when `s` is a positive number. The categorified version
of this formula then becomes

```text
Σ ( n : ℕ ∖ {0}),
  ( Σ (F : Type-With-Cardinality-ℕ n) , T (F) × (S → cycle-prime-decomposition-ℕ (n))
```

We can generalize the two notions to species of types in subuniverses. Let `P`
and `Q` two subuniverse such that `P` is closed by cartesian product. Let
`H : P → UU` be a species such that for every `X , Y : P` the following equality
is satisfied `H (X × Y) ≃ H X × H Y`. Then we can define the `H`-Dirichlet
series to any species of subuniverse `T` by

```text
Σ (X : P) (T (X) × (S → H (X)))
```

The condition on `H` ensure that all the usual properties of the Dirichlet
series are satisfied.

## Definition

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 l3 l4 : Level}
  (H : species-types l1 l2)
  (C1 : preserves-product-species-types H)
  (T : species-types l1 l3)
  (S : UU l4)
  where

  dirichlet-series-species-types : UU (lsuc l1 ⊔ l2 ⊔ l3 ⊔ l4)
  dirichlet-series-species-types = Σ (UU l1) (λ X → (T X) × (S → H (X)))
```
