## Idea

When we think of a species of types as the coefficients of a formal power
series, the derivative of a species of types is the species of types
representing the derivative of that formal power series.

## Definition

```agda
derivative-species-types :
  {l1 l2 : Level} → species-types l1 l2 → species-types l1 l2
derivative-species-types F X = F (X + unit)
```
