## Idea

The **intersection** of two ideals `I` and `J` in a commutative ring is the
ideal consisting of the elements contained in both of the ideals `I` and `J`.

## Definitions

### The universal property of intersections of radical ideals

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 l3 : Level} (A : Commutative-Ring l1)
  (I : ideal-Commutative-Ring l2 A)
  (J : ideal-Commutative-Ring l3 A)
  where

  is-intersection-ideal-Commutative-Ring :
    {l4 : Level} (K : ideal-Commutative-Ring l4 A) → UUω
  is-intersection-ideal-Commutative-Ring K =
    is-greatest-binary-lower-bound-Large-Poset
      ( ideal-Commutative-Ring-Large-Poset A)
      ( I)
      ( J)
      ( K)
