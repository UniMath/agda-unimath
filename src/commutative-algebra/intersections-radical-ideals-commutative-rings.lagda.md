## Idea

The **intersection** of two
[radical ideals](commutative-algebra.radical-ideals-commutative-rings.md)
consists of the elements contained in both of them. Given two radical ideals `I`
and `J`, their intersection can be computed as

```text
  I ∩ J ＝ √ IJ,
```

where `IJ` is the
[product](commutative-algebra.products-ideals-commutative-rings.md) of `I` and
`J`.

### The intersection of radical ideals is the radical of the ideal generated by their product

Given two radical ideals `I` and `J`, we claim that

```text
  I ∩ J ＝ √ IJ,
```

where `IJ` is the
[product](commutative-algebra.products-ideals-commutative-rings.md) of the
ideals `I` and `J`. To prove this, it suffices to prove the inclusions

```text
  IJ ⊆ I ∩ J ⊆ √ IJ.
```

Note that any product of elements in `I` and `J` is in the intersection `I ∩ J`.
This settles the first inclusion. For the second inclusion, note that if
`x ∈ I ∩ J`, then `x² ∈ IJ` so it follows that `x ∈ √ IJ`.
