## Idea

The **Zariski topology** on the set of prime ideals in a commutative ring is
described by what the closed sets are: A subset `I` of prime ideals is closed if
it is the intersection of all the prime ideals that

## Definitions

### Closed subsets in the Zariski topology

```agda
standard-closed-subset-zariski-topology-Commutative-Ring :
  {l1 l2 l3 : Level} (A : Commutative-Ring l1) →
  subtype l3 (type-Commutative-Ring A) →
  subtype (l1 ⊔ l2 ⊔ l3) (prime-ideal-Commutative-Ring l2 A)
standard-closed-subset-zariski-topology-Commutative-Ring A U P =
  leq-prop-subtype U (subset-prime-ideal-Commutative-Ring A P)
