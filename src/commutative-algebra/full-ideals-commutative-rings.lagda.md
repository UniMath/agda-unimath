## Idea

A **full ideal** in a
[commutative ring](commutative-algebra.commutative-rings.md) `A` is an
[ideal](commutative-algebra.ideals-commutative-rings.md) that contains every
element of `A`.

## Definitions

### The predicate of being a full ideal

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} (A : Commutative-Ring l1) (I : ideal-Commutative-Ring l2 A)
  where

  is-full-ideal-Commutative-Ring-Prop : Prop (l1 ⊔ l2)

    is-full-ideal-Ring-Prop (ring-Commutative-Ring A) I

## Properties

### Any ideal is full if and only if it contains `1`

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} (A : Commutative-Ring l1) (I : ideal-Commutative-Ring l2 A)
  where

  is-full-contains-one-ideal-Commutative-Ring :
    is-in-ideal-Commutative-Ring A I (one-Commutative-Ring A) →
    is-full-ideal-Commutative-Ring A I
  is-full-contains-one-ideal-Commutative-Ring =
    is-full-contains-one-ideal-Ring (ring-Commutative-Ring A) I

  contains-one-is-full-ideal-Commutative-Ring :
    is-full-ideal-Commutative-Ring A I →
    is-in-ideal-Commutative-Ring A I (one-Commutative-Ring A)
  contains-one-is-full-ideal-Commutative-Ring =
    contains-one-is-full-ideal-Ring (ring-Commutative-Ring A) I
```

### Any ideal is full if and only if it is a top element in the large poset of ideals

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} (A : Commutative-Ring l1) (I : ideal-Commutative-Ring l2 A)
  where

  is-full-is-top-element-ideal-Commutative-Ring :

### The full ideal of a commutative ring is radical

```agda
module _
  {l1 : Level} (A : Commutative-Ring l1)
  where

  is-radical-full-ideal-Commutative-Ring :
    is-radical-ideal-Commutative-Ring A (full-ideal-Commutative-Ring A)
  is-radical-full-ideal-Commutative-Ring x n H = raise-star

  full-radical-ideal-Commutative-Ring : radical-ideal-Commutative-Ring lzero A
