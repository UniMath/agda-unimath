## Idea

The **radical** `√ I` of an ideal `I` in a commutative ring `A` is the least
[radical ideal](commutative-algebra.radical-ideals-commutative-rings.md) of `A`
containing `I`. The radical `√ I` is constructed as the ideal consisting of all
elements `f` for which there exists an `n` such that `fⁿ ∈ I`.

The operation `I ↦ √ I` is a
[reflective Galois connection](order-theory.reflective-galois-connections-large-posets.md)
from the [large poset](order-theory.large-posets.md) of
[ideals](commutative-algebra.ideals-commutative-rings.md) in `A` into the large
poset of radical ideals in `A`.
