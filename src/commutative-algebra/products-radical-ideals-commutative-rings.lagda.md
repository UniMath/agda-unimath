## Idea

The **product** of two
[radical ideals](commutative-algebra.radical-ideals-commutative-rings.md) `I`
and `J` is the
[radical](commutative-algebra.radicals-of-ideals-commutative-rings.md) of the
[product](commutative-algebra.products-ideals-commutative-rings.md) of `I` and
`J`. In other words, the product of two radical ideals `I` and `J` is the least
radical ideal that contains the products of elements in `I` and in `J`.

## Properties

### Radical laws for products of ideals

#### `√ (I · √ J) ＝ √ IJ`

For the forward inclusion, assume that `x ∈ I` and `y ∈ √ J`. Then there exists
an `n` such that `yⁿ ∈ J`. It follows that

```text
  (xy)ⁿ⁺¹ ＝ xⁿ⁺¹yⁿ⁺¹ = (xxⁿ)(yⁿy) ＝ (xyⁿ)(xⁿy) ∈ IJ,
```

and hence `xy ∈ √ IJ`. The backwards inclusion is clear, since `J ⊆ √ J`.
