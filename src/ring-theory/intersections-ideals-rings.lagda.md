## Idea

The **intersection** of two [ideals](ring-theory.ideals-rings.md) of a
[ring](ring-theory.rings.md) `R` consists of the elements contained in both of
them.

## Definitions

### The universal property of intersections of ideals in rings

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 l3 : Level} (A : Ring l1)
  (I : ideal-Ring l2 A)
  (J : ideal-Ring l3 A)
  where

  is-intersection-ideal-Ring :
    {l4 : Level} (K : ideal-Ring l4 A) → UUω
  is-intersection-ideal-Ring K =
    is-greatest-binary-lower-bound-Large-Poset
      ( ideal-Ring-Large-Poset A)
      ( I)
      ( J)
      ( K)
```
