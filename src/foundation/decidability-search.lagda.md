## Idea

A type `X` has
{{#concept "decidability search" Disambiguation="on type" Agda=has-decidability-search}}
if we have a terminating algorithm `f` that, for every
[decidable type family](foundation.decidable-type-families.md) `P` on `X`
computes an element in `P` or produces a proof that `P` is the empty family.

**Terminology.** In the terminology of Martín Escardó, a type that has
decidability search on decidable _subtypes_ is referred to as _searchable_,
_exhaustively searchable_, _exhaustibly searchable_, _exhaustible_,
_omniscient_, _satisfying the principle of omniscience_, _compact_, or
_Σ-compact_. {{#cite Esc08}} {{#cite TypeTopology}} We reserve the term
_decidability searchable_ for types for which there (merely)
[exists](foundation.existential-quantification.md) a decidability search.

### The two small predicate of having pointed decidability search are equivalent

```agda
flip-has-pointed-decidability-search-bool :
  {l : Level} {X : UU l} →
  has-pointed-decidability-search-bool' X →
  has-pointed-decidability-search-bool X
pr1 (flip-has-pointed-decidability-search-bool H b) = pr1 (H (neg-bool ∘ b))
pr2 (flip-has-pointed-decidability-search-bool H b) p x =
  is-true-is-false-neg-bool
    ( pr2
      ( H (neg-bool ∘ b))
      ( is-false-is-true-neg-bool
        ( is-involution-neg-bool (b (pr1 (H (neg-bool ∘ b)))) ∙ p))
      ( x))
```

> The converse remains to be formalized.

### Standard finite types have decidability search

```agda
has-decidability-search-Fin : (n : ℕ) → has-decidability-search (Fin n)
has-decidability-search-Fin zero-ℕ = has-decidability-search-empty
has-decidability-search-Fin (succ-ℕ n) =
  has-decidability-search-coproduct
    ( has-decidability-search-Fin n)
    ( has-decidability-search-unit)
```

### Types equipped with a counting have decidability search

```agda
has-decidability-search-count :
  {l : Level} {X : UU l} → count X → has-decidability-search X
has-decidability-search-count f =
  has-decidability-search-equiv'
    ( equiv-count f)
    ( has-decidability-search-Fin (number-of-elements-count f))
```

### The booleans have decidability search

```agda
has-decidability-search-bool' : has-decidability-search bool
has-decidability-search-bool' =
  has-decidability-search-equiv'
    ( equiv-bool-Fin-2)
    ( has-decidability-search-Fin 2)
```

### The subuniverse of propositions has decidability search

```agda
-- has-decidability-search-Prop : {l : Level} → has-decidability-search (Prop l)
-- has-decidability-search-Prop {l} P =
--   rec-coproduct
--     ( λ p → inl (raise-unit-Prop l , p))
--     ( λ np →
--       rec-coproduct
--         ( λ q → inl (raise-empty-Prop l , q))
--         (λ nq → inr {!   !})
--         ( is-decidable-decidable-family P (raise-empty-Prop l)))
--     ( is-decidable-decidable-family P (raise-unit-Prop l))
```
