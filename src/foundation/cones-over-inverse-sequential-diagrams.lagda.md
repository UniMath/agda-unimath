## Idea

A **cone over an
[inverse sequential diagram](foundation.inverse-sequential-diagrams.md) `A` with
domain `X`** is a [sequence](foundation.dependent-sequences.md) of functions
from `X` into the sequence of types of `A` such that the triangles

```text
     X
    / \
   /   \
  ∨     ∨
 Aₙ₊₁ -> Aₙ
```

[commute](foundation-core.commuting-triangles-of-maps.md) for all `n : ℕ`.
