## Idea

The [axiom of choice](foundation.axiom-of-choice.md) implies the
[law of excluded middle](foundation.law-of-excluded-middle.md). This is often
referred to as
{{#concept "Diaconescu's theorem" WD="Diaconescu's theorem" WDID=Q3527059 Agda=theorem-Diaconescu}}.

## Theorem

We follow the proof given under Theorem 10.1.14 in {{#cite UF13}}.

**Proof.** Given a [proposition](foundation-core.propositions.md) `P`, then its
[suspension](synthetic-homotopy-theory.suspensions-of-propositions.md) `ΣP` is a
[set](foundation-core.sets.md) with the property that `(N ＝ S) ≃ ΣP`, where `N`
and `S` are the _poles_ of `ΣP`. There is a surjection from the
[booleans](foundation.booleans.md) onto the suspension `f : bool ↠ ΣP` such that
`f true ≐ N` and `f false ≐ S`. Its
[fiber family](foundation-core.fibers-of-maps.md) is in other words an
[inhabited](foundation.inhabited-types.md) family over `ΣP`. Applying the axiom
of choice to this family, we obtain a
[mere](foundation.propositional-truncations.md)
[section](foundation-core.sections.md) `s` of `f` which thus exhibits `P` as a
[logical equivalent](foundation.logical-equivalences.md) to `f⁻¹ N ＝ f⁻¹ S`.
The latter is an [equation](foundation-core.identity-types.md) of booleans, and
the booleans have [decidable equality](foundation.decidable-equality.md) so `P`
must also be [decidable](foundation.decidable-propositions.md).
