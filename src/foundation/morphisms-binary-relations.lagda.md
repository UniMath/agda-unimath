## Idea

A **morphism** of [binary relations](foundation.binary-relations.md) `R` and `S`
on a type `A` is a family of maps `R x y → S x y` for every pair `x y : A`.

## Definition

### Morphisms of binary relations

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 l3 : Level} {A : UU l1}
  where

  hom-Relation : Relation l2 A → Relation l3 A → UU (l1 ⊔ l2 ⊔ l3)
  hom-Relation R S = (x y : A) → R x y → S x y
```

## Properties

### Characterization of equality of morphisms of binary relations

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 l3 : Level} {A : UU l1} {R : Relation l2 A} {S : Relation l3 A}
  where

  htpy-hom-Relation : (f g : hom-Relation R S) → UU (l1 ⊔ l2 ⊔ l3)
  htpy-hom-Relation = binary-htpy

  extensionality-hom-Relation :
    (f g : hom-Relation R S) → (f ＝ g) ≃ binary-htpy f g
  extensionality-hom-Relation = extensionality-binary-Π

  htpy-eq-hom-Relation :
    (f g : hom-Relation R S) → (f ＝ g) → binary-htpy f g
  htpy-eq-hom-Relation = binary-htpy-eq

  eq-htpy-hom-Relation :
    (f g : hom-Relation R S) → binary-htpy f g → f ＝ g
  eq-htpy-hom-Relation = eq-binary-htpy
```
