## Idea

A type `A` is {{#concept "indiscrete" Disambiguation="type" Agda=is-indiscrete}}
if it is
[fiberwise orthogonal](orthogonal-factorization-systems.fiberwise-orthogonal-maps.md)
to the map

```text
  ℕ + {∞} → ℕ∞.
```

This defines a topological
[modality](orthogonal-factorization-systems.higher-modalities.md) presented by
the predicate that `∞` is an isolated element in `ℕ∞`.

The terminology _indiscrete_ is justified by the topological model of type
theory: a type is indiscrete if and only if every sequence of points converges
to every element.

## Definitions

### The predicate of being indiscrete

```agda
is-indiscrete : {l : Level} → UU l → UU l
is-indiscrete A = (n : ℕ∞↑) → is-null (is-decidable (infinity-ℕ∞↑ ＝ n)) A
```

### The type of indiscrete types

```agda
Indiscrete-Type : (l : Level) → UU (lsuc l)
Indiscrete-Type l = Σ (UU l) (is-indiscrete)

module _
  {l : Level} (X : Indiscrete-Type l)
  where

  type-Indiscrete-Type : UU l
  type-Indiscrete-Type = pr1 X

  is-indiscrete-type-Indiscrete-Type : is-indiscrete type-Indiscrete-Type
  is-indiscrete-type-Indiscrete-Type = pr2 X
```

## Properties

### A type is local at the inclusion `ℕ+{∞} → ℕ∞` if and only if it views `∞` as isolated

> This remains to be formalized.

### Indiscrete types are closed under dependent sums

This is a corollary of being a topological modality.

> This remains to be formalized.

### Indiscrete types are closed under dependent products

This is a corollary of being a topological modality.

> This remains to be formalized.

### The identity types of an indiscrete type are indiscrete

This is a corollary of being a topological modality.

> This remains to be formalized.

## Conjectures

### If the booleans are indiscrete, then the weak limited principle of omniscience holds

> This remains to be formalized.

### Indiscrete types are logically compact

> This remains to be formalized.
