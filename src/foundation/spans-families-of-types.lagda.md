## Idea

Consider a family of types `A i` indexed by `i : I`. A
{{#concept "span" Disambiguation="family of types" Agda=span-type-family}} on
`A` consists of a type `S` equipped with a family of maps

```text
  (i : I) → S → A i.
```

The type `S` is called the
{{#concept "spanning type" Disambiguation="span of family of types" Agda=spanning-type-span-type-family}}
of the span.

## Definitions

### Spans on families of types

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} (l3 : Level) {I : UU l1} (A : I → UU l2)
  where

  span-type-family : UU (l1 ⊔ l2 ⊔ lsuc l3)
  span-type-family = Σ (UU l3) (λ S → (i : I) → S → A i)

module _
  {l1 l2 l3 : Level} {I : UU l1} {A : I → UU l2}
  (s : span-type-family l3 A)
  where

  spanning-type-span-type-family : UU l3
  spanning-type-span-type-family = pr1 s

  map-span-type-family :
    (i : I) → spanning-type-span-type-family → A i
  map-span-type-family = pr2 s
```
