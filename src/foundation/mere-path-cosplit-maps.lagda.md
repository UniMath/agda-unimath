## Idea

In Homotopy Type Theory, there are multiple nonequivalent ways to state that a
map is "injective" that are more or less informed by the homotopy structures of
its domain and codomain. A
{{#concept "mere path-cosplit map" Disambiguation="between types" Agda=is-mere-path-cosplit}}
is one such notion, lying somewhere between
[embeddings](foundation-core.embeddings.md) and
[injective maps](foundation-core.injective-maps.md). In fact, given an integer
`k ≥ -2`, if we understand `k`-injective map to mean the `k+2`-dimensional
[action on identifications](foundation.action-on-higher-identifications-functions.md)
has a converse map, then we have proper inclusions

```text
  k-injective maps ⊃ k-path-cosplit maps ⊃ k-truncated maps.
```

While `k`-truncatedness answers the question:

> At which dimension is the action on higher identifications of a function
> always an [equivalence](foundation-core.equivalences.md)?

Mere `k`-path-cosplitting instead answers the question:

> At which dimension is the action merely a
> [retract](foundation-core.retracts-of-types.md)?

Thus a _merely `-2`-path-cosplit map_ is a map that merely is a retract. A
_merely `k+1`-path-cosplit map_ is a map whose
[action on identifications](foundation.action-on-identifications-functions.md)
is merely `k`-path-cosplit.

We show that mere `k`-path-cosplittness coincides with `k`-truncatedness when
the codomain is `k`-truncated, but more generally mere `k`-path-cosplitting may
only induce mere retracts on higher homotopy groups.

## Definitions

```agda
is-mere-path-cosplit :
  {l1 l2 : Level} (k : 𝕋) {A : UU l1} {B : UU l2} → (A → B) → UU (l1 ⊔ l2)
is-mere-path-cosplit neg-two-𝕋 f = is-inhabited (retraction f)
is-mere-path-cosplit (succ-𝕋 k) {A} f =
  (x y : A) → is-mere-path-cosplit k (ap f {x} {y})
```

## Properties

### Being merely path-cosplit is a property

```agda
is-prop-is-mere-path-cosplit :
  {l1 l2 : Level} (k : 𝕋) {A : UU l1} {B : UU l2} (f : A → B) →
  is-prop (is-mere-path-cosplit k f)
is-prop-is-mere-path-cosplit neg-two-𝕋 f =
  is-property-is-inhabited (retraction f)
is-prop-is-mere-path-cosplit (succ-𝕋 k) f =
  is-prop-Π (λ x → is-prop-Π λ y → is-prop-is-mere-path-cosplit k (ap f))

is-mere-path-cosplit-Prop :
  {l1 l2 : Level} (k : 𝕋) {A : UU l1} {B : UU l2} → (A → B) → Prop (l1 ⊔ l2)
is-mere-path-cosplit-Prop k f =
  (is-mere-path-cosplit k f , is-prop-is-mere-path-cosplit k f)
```

### If a map is `k`-truncated then it is merely `k`-path-cosplit

```agda
is-mere-path-cosplit-is-trunc :
  {l1 l2 : Level} (k : 𝕋) {A : UU l1} {B : UU l2} {f : A → B} →
  is-trunc-map k f → is-mere-path-cosplit k f
is-mere-path-cosplit-is-trunc neg-two-𝕋 is-trunc-f =
  unit-trunc-Prop (retraction-is-contr-map is-trunc-f)
is-mere-path-cosplit-is-trunc (succ-𝕋 k) {f = f} is-trunc-f x y =
  is-mere-path-cosplit-is-trunc k
    ( is-trunc-map-ap-is-trunc-map k f is-trunc-f x y)
```

### If a map is `k`-path-cosplit then it is merely `k+1`-path-cosplit

```agda
is-mere-path-cosplit-succ-is-mere-path-cosplit :
  {l1 l2 : Level} (k : 𝕋) {A : UU l1} {B : UU l2} {f : A → B} →
  is-mere-path-cosplit k f → is-mere-path-cosplit (succ-𝕋 k) f
is-mere-path-cosplit-succ-is-mere-path-cosplit
  neg-two-𝕋 {f = f} is-cosplit-f x y =
  rec-trunc-Prop
    ( is-mere-path-cosplit-Prop neg-two-𝕋 (ap f))
    ( λ r → unit-trunc-Prop (retraction-ap f r))
    ( is-cosplit-f)
is-mere-path-cosplit-succ-is-mere-path-cosplit (succ-𝕋 k) is-cosplit-f x y =
  is-mere-path-cosplit-succ-is-mere-path-cosplit k (is-cosplit-f x y)
```

### If a type maps into a `k`-truncated type via a merely `k`-path-cosplit map then it is `k`-truncated

```agda
is-trunc-domain-is-mere-path-cosplit-is-trunc-codomain :
  {l1 l2 : Level} (k : 𝕋) {A : UU l1} {B : UU l2} {f : A → B} →
  is-trunc k B → is-mere-path-cosplit k f → is-trunc k A
is-trunc-domain-is-mere-path-cosplit-is-trunc-codomain neg-two-𝕋
  {A} {B} {f} is-trunc-B =
  rec-trunc-Prop
    ( is-trunc-Prop neg-two-𝕋 A)
    ( λ r → is-trunc-retract-of (f , r) is-trunc-B)
is-trunc-domain-is-mere-path-cosplit-is-trunc-codomain
  (succ-𝕋 k) {A} {B} {f} is-trunc-B is-cosplit-f x y =
  is-trunc-domain-is-mere-path-cosplit-is-trunc-codomain k
    ( is-trunc-B (f x) (f y))
    ( is-cosplit-f x y)
```

This result generalizes the following statements:

- A type that injects into a set is a set.

- A type that embeds into a `k+1`-truncated type is `k+1`-truncated.

- A type that maps into a `k`-truncated type via a `k`-truncated map is
  `k`-truncated.

### If the codomain of a mere `k`-path-cosplit map is `k`-truncated then the map is `k`-truncated

```agda
is-trunc-map-is-mere-path-cosplit-is-trunc-codomain :
  {l1 l2 : Level} (k : 𝕋) {A : UU l1} {B : UU l2} {f : A → B} →
  is-trunc k B → is-mere-path-cosplit k f → is-trunc-map k f
is-trunc-map-is-mere-path-cosplit-is-trunc-codomain k is-trunc-B is-cosplit-f =
  is-trunc-map-is-trunc-domain-codomain k
    ( is-trunc-domain-is-mere-path-cosplit-is-trunc-codomain k
      ( is-trunc-B)
      ( is-cosplit-f))
    ( is-trunc-B)
```
