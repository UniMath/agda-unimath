## Idea

A **morphism of inverse sequential diagrams** `A → B` is a commuting diagram of
the form

```text
  ⋯ ----> Aₙ₊₁ ----> Aₙ ----> ⋯ ----> A₁ ----> A₀
           |         |       |       |        |
  ⋯        |         |       ⋯       |        |
           ∨         ∨       ∨       ∨        ∨
  ⋯ ----> Bₙ₊₁ ----> Bₙ ----> ⋯ ----> B₁ ----> B₀.
```
