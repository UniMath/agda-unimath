## Idea

The
{{#concept "Regensburg extension" Disambiguation="of the fundamental theorem of identity types" Agda=extended-fundamental-theorem-id}}
of the
[fundamental theorem of identity types](foundation.fundamental-theorem-of-identity-types.md)
asserts that for any [subuniverse](foundation.subuniverses.md) `P`, and any
[pointed](structured-types.pointed-types.md)
[connected type](foundation.connected-types.md) `A` equipped with a type family
`B` over `A`, the following are
[logically equivalent](foundation.logical-equivalences.md):

1. Every family of maps `f : (x : A) → (* ＝ x) → B x` is a family of `P`-maps,
   i.e., a family of maps with [fibers](foundation-core.fibers-of-maps.md) in
   `P`.
2. The [total space](foundation.dependent-pair-types.md) `Σ A B` is
   [`P`-separated](foundation.separated-types-subuniverses.md), i.e., its
   [identity types](foundation-core.identity-types.md) are in `P`.

In other words, the extended fundamental theorem of
[identity types](foundation-core.identity-types.md) asserts that for any
[higher group](higher-group-theory.higher-groups.md) `BG` equipped with a
[higher group action](higher-group-theory.higher-group-actions.md) `X`, every
[homomorphism of higher group actions](higher-group-theory.homomorphisms-higher-group-actions.md)
`f : (u : BG) → (* ＝ u) → X u` consists of a family of `P` maps if and only if
the type of [orbits](higher-group-theory.orbits-higher-group-actions.md) of `X`
is `P`-separated.

**Proof:** Suppose that every family of maps `f : (x : A) → (* ＝ x) → B x` is a
family of `P`-maps. The [fiber](foundation-core.fibers-of-maps.md) of such
`f x : (* ＝ x) → B x` at `y` is [equivalent](foundation-core.equivalences.md)
to the type `(* , f * refl) ＝ (x , y)`. Our assumption is therefore equivalent
to the assumption that the type `(* , f * refl) ＝ (x , y)` is in `P` for every
`f`, `x`, and `y`. By the
[universal property of identity types](foundation.universal-property-identity-types.md),
this condition is equivalent to the condition that `(* , y') ＝ (x , y)` is in
`P` for every `y'`, `x`, and `y`. Finally, since `A` is assumed to be connected,
this condition is equivalent to the condition that `Σ A B` is `P`-separated.

This theorem was stated and proven for the first time during the
[Interactions of Proof Assistants and Mathematics](https://itp-school-2023.github.io)
summer school in Regensburg, 2023, as part of
[Egbert Rijke](https://egbertrijke.github.io)'s tutorial on formalization in
agda-unimath.

## Theorem

### The unbased extended fundamental theorem of identity types

We give a similar characterization for a binary family of types `B : A → A → 𝒰`
over a not necessarily pointed or inhabited type `A` whose elements are all
merely equal. In other words, `A` is any π₀-trivial type. The characterization
asserts that the following are equivalent:

1. For every `x : A`, every family of maps out of the identity types
   `f : (y : A) → (x ＝ y) → B x y`, is a family of `𝒫`-maps.
2. For every `x : A` the type `Σ A (B x)` is `𝒫`-separated.

This unbased extension of the fundamental theorem was not stated or proved at
the Regensburg summer school, but was later contributed by
[Fredrik Bakke](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/fredrik.bakke) in January 2025.

## See also

The Regensburg extension of the fundamental theorem is used in the following
files:

- In
  [`higher-group-theory.free-higher-group-actions`](higher-group-theory.free-higher-group-actions.md)
  it is used to show that a higher group action is free if and only its total
  space is a set.
- In
  [`higher-group-theory.transitive-higher-group-actions`](higher-group-theory.transitive-higher-group-actions.md)
  it is used to show that a higher group action is transitive if and only if its
  total space is connected.

## References

Two special cases of the extended fundamental theorem of identity types are
stated in {{#cite Rij22}}: The case where `P` is the subuniverse of
`k`-truncated types is stated as Theorem 19.6.2; and the case where `P` is the
subuniverse of inhabited types is stated as Exercise 19.14.
