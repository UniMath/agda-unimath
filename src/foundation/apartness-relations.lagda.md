## Idea

An **apartness relation** on a type `A` is a
[relation](foundation.binary-relations.md) `R` which is

- **Antireflexive:** For any `a : A` we have `¬ (R a a)`
- **Symmetric:** For any `a b : A` we have `R a b → R b a`
- **Cotransitive:** For any `a b c : A` we have `R a b → R a c ∨ R b c`.

The idea of an apartness relation `R` is that `R a b` holds if you can
positively establish a difference between `a` and `b`. For example, two subsets
`A` and `B` of a type `X` are apart if we can find an element that is in the
[symmetric difference](foundation.symmetric-difference.md) of `A` and `B`.

## Definitions

### Apartness relations

```agda

  where

  is-antireflexive : UU (l1 ⊔ l2)

  is-consistent : UU (l1 ⊔ l2)

### Apartness on the type of functions into a type with an apartness relation
