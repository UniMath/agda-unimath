## Idea

An [apartness relation](foundation.apartness-relations.md) `#` is said to be
**standard** if the
[law of excluded middle](foundation.law-of-excluded-middle.md) implies that `#`
is [equivalent](foundation.logical-equivalences.md) to
[negated equality](foundation.negated-equality.md).

## Definition

```agda
is-standard-Apartness-Relation :
  {l1 l2 : Level} (l3 : Level) {A : UU l1} (R : Apartness-Relation l2 A) →
  UU (l1 ⊔ l2 ⊔ lsuc l3)
is-standard-Apartness-Relation {l1} {l2} l3 {A} R =
  LEM l3 → (x y : A) → (x ≠ y) ↔ apart-Apartness-Relation R x y
```

## Properties

### Any tight apartness relation is standard

```agda
is-standard-is-tight-Apartness-Relation :
  {l1 l2 : Level} {A : UU l1} (R : Apartness-Relation l2 A) →
  is-tight-Apartness-Relation R → is-standard-Apartness-Relation l2 R
pr1 (is-standard-is-tight-Apartness-Relation R H lem x y) np =
  double-negation-elim-is-decidable
    ( lem (rel-Apartness-Relation R x y))
    ( map-neg (H x y) np)
pr2 (is-standard-is-tight-Apartness-Relation R H lem x .x) r refl =
  antirefl-Apartness-Relation R x r
```
