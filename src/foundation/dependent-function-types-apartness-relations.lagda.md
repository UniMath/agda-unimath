## Idea

Given a family `Y` of types with
[apartness relations](foundation.apartness-relations.md) over `X`, then the
[dependent function type](foundation.dependent-function-types.md) `Π X Y` again
has an apartness relation. Two dependent functions `f` and `g` are **apart** in
`Π X Y` if there [exists](foundation.existential-quantification.md) an `x : X`
such that `f x` is apart from `g x` in `Y x`. If the apartness relations on `Y`
are [tight](foundation.tight-apartness-relations.md) then so is the apartness
relation on `Π X Y`.
