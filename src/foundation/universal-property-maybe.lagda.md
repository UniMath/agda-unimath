## Idea

We combine the
[universal property of coproducts](foundation.universal-property-coproduct-types.md)
and the [unit type](foundation.universal-property-unit-type.md) to obtain the
{{#concept "universal property of the maybe monad"  Agda=dependent-universal-property-Maybe}}.

```agda

  pr1 (ev-Maybe h) x = h (unit-Maybe x)
  pr2 (ev-Maybe h) = h exception-Maybe

  ind-Maybe :
    ((x : A) → B (unit-Maybe x)) × (B exception-Maybe) → (x : Maybe A) → B x
  ind-Maybe (pair h b) (inl x) = h x
  ind-Maybe (pair h b) (inr _) = b
