## Idea

{{#concept "Cantor's theorem" Agda=theorem-Cantor WD="Cantor's theorem" WDID=Q474881}}
shows that there is [no](foundation-core.negation.md)
[surjective map](foundation.surjective-maps.md) from a type onto its
[powerset](foundation.powersets.md).

```text
  ¬ (A ↠ 𝒫(A))
```

In fact, no map `A → PA` into a
[complement](foundation.complements-subtypes.md)-closed
[subset](foundation-core.subtypes.md) `PA` of the powerset may be
[double negation dense](logic.double-negation-dense-maps.md).

## Theorem

**Proof.** The proof is an instance of an argument _by diagonalization_. Given a
function `f : A → 𝒫(A)` we may define an element of the powerset `𝒫(A)` that `f`
cannot possibly hit. This subtype is defined by

```text
  B := {x ∈ A | x ∉ f(x)}
```

which is given formally by the predicate `x ↦ ¬ (f x x)`. If this subtype were
to be hit by `f`, that would mean there is a `ξ ∈ A` such that `f(ξ) = B`. This
would have to be a fixed point of the negation operation, since

```text
  f(ξ)(ξ) = B(ξ) = ¬ (f(ξ)(ξ)),
```

but negation has no fixed points.

Cantor's theorem is the [63rd](literature.100-theorems.md#63) theorem on
[Freek Wiedijk](http://www.cs.ru.nl/F.Wiedijk/)'s list of
[100 theorems](literature.100-theorems.md) {{#cite 100theorems}}.
