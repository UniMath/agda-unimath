## Idea

Given a type `Y` with an [apartness relation](foundation.apartness-relations.md)
and an arbitrary type `X`, then the
[function type](foundation.function-types.md) `X → Y` again has an apartness
relation. Two functions `f` and `g` are **apart** in `X → Y` if there
[exists](foundation.existential-quantification.md) an `x : X` such that `f x` is
apart from `g x` in `Y`. If the apartness relation on `Y` is
[tight](foundation.tight-apartness-relations.md) then so is the apartness
relation on `X → Y`.

## Properties

### Apartness on the type of functions into a type with an apartness relation

```agda
