## Idea

Given two [coalgebras](foundation.coalgebras-maybe.md) of the
[maybe monad](foundation.maybe.md) `η : X → Maybe X`, `η' : Y → Maybe Y`, then a
map `f : X → Y` is a
{{#concept "morphism of coalgebras" Disambiguation="of the maybe monad" Agda=hom-coalgebra-Maybe}}
if the square

```text
            f
     X ----------> Y
     |             |
     |             |
     ∨             ∨
  Maybe X ----> Maybe Y
         Maybe f
```
