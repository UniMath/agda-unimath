## Idea

A standard finite tree is a finite tree that branches by standard finite sets.
In contexts where one wouldn't be interested in considering finite trees to be
the same if they differ up to a permutation of trees, people simply call our
standard finite trees finite trees. From a univalent perspective, however, a
finite tree is a tree built out of finite types, not just the standard finite
types. Sometimes, standard finite trees are called planar finite trees, to
emphasize that the branching types `Fin n` record the order in which the
branches occur.

## Definition

```agda
data Tree-Fin : UU lzero where
  tree-Fin : (n : ℕ) → (Fin n → Tree-Fin) → Tree-Fin

root-Tree-Fin : Tree-Fin
root-Tree-Fin = tree-Fin zero-ℕ ex-falso

number-nodes-Tree-Fin : Tree-Fin → ℕ
number-nodes-Tree-Fin (tree-Fin zero-ℕ _) = zero-ℕ
number-nodes-Tree-Fin (tree-Fin (succ-ℕ n) f) =
  succ-ℕ (sum-Fin-ℕ (succ-ℕ n) (λ k → number-nodes-Tree-Fin (f k)))

height-Tree-Fin : Tree-Fin → ℕ
height-Tree-Fin (tree-Fin zero-ℕ f) = zero-ℕ
height-Tree-Fin (tree-Fin (succ-ℕ n) f) =
  succ-ℕ (max-Fin-ℕ (succ-ℕ n) (λ k → height-Tree-Fin (f k)))

is-leaf-Tree-Fin : Tree-Fin → UU lzero
is-leaf-Tree-Fin (tree-Fin zero-ℕ _) = unit
is-leaf-Tree-Fin (tree-Fin (succ-ℕ n) _) = empty

is-full-binary-Tree-Fin : Tree-Fin → UU lzero
is-full-binary-Tree-Fin (tree-Fin zero-ℕ f) = unit
is-full-binary-Tree-Fin (tree-Fin (succ-ℕ n) f) =
  (Id 2 n) × ((k : Fin (succ-ℕ n)) → is-full-binary-Tree-Fin (f k))
```
