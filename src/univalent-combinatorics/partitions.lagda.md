## Idea

A **partition** of a [finite type](univalent-combinatorics.finite-types.md) `X`
can be defined in several equivalent ways:

- A partition is a [subset](foundation.subtypes.md) `P` of the
  [powerset](foundation.powersets.md) of `X` such that each `U ⊆ X` in `P` is
  [inhabited](foundation.inhabited-types.md) and each element `x : X` is in
  exactly one subset `U ⊆ X` in `P`.
- A partition is an
  [equivalence relation](foundation-core.equivalence-relations.md) on `X`
- A partition is a decomposition of `X` into a type of the form `Σ A B` where
  `A` is finite and `B` is a family of inhabited finite types, i.e., it consists
  of such `A` and `B` and an [equivalence](foundation-core.equivalences.md)
  `X ≃ Σ A B`.

Note that the last description is subtly different from the notion of
[unlabeled partition](univalent-combinatorics.ferrers-diagrams.md) (i.e.,
Ferrers diagram), because it only uses
[mere equivalences](foundation.mere-equivalences.md).
