## Idea

An **inhabited finite type** is a
[finite type](univalent-combinatorics.finite-types.md) that is
[inhabited](foundation.inhabited-types.md), meaning it is a type that is
[merely equivalent](foundation.mere-equivalences.md) to a
[standard finite type](univalent-combinatorics.standard-finite-types.md), and
that comes equipped with a term of its
[propositional truncation](foundation.propositional-truncations.md).

      ( finite-type-Inhabited-Finite-Type Y)
      ( e))

### Every type in `Type-With-Cardinality-ℕ (succ-ℕ n)` is an inhabited finite type

```agda
