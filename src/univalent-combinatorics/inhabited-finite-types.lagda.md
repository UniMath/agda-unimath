## Idea

An **inhabited finite type** is a
[finite type](univalent-combinatorics.finite-types.md) that is
[inhabited](foundation.inhabited-types.md), meaning it is a type that is
[merely equivalent](foundation.mere-equivalences.md) to a
[standard finite type](univalent-combinatorics.standard-finite-types.md), and
that comes equipped with a term of its
[propositional truncation](foundation.propositional-truncations.md).

### Families of inhabited types

```agda
Family-Of-Inhabited-Finite-Types :
  {l1 : Level} → (l2 : Level) → (X : Finite-Type l1) → UU (l1 ⊔ lsuc l2)
Family-Of-Inhabited-Finite-Types l2 X = type-Finite-Type X → Inhabited-Finite-Type l2

module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} (X : Finite-Type l1) (Y : Family-Of-Inhabited-Finite-Types l2 X)
  where

  type-Family-Of-Inhabited-Finite-Types : type-Finite-Type X → UU l2
  type-Family-Of-Inhabited-Finite-Types x = type-Inhabited-Finite-Type (Y x)

  finite-type-Family-Of-Inhabited-Finite-Types : type-Finite-Type X → Finite-Type l2
  pr1 (finite-type-Family-Of-Inhabited-Finite-Types x) = type-Family-Of-Inhabited-Finite-Types x

## Proposition

### Equality in inhabited finite types

```agda
eq-equiv-Inhabited-Finite-Type :
  {l : Level} → (X Y : Inhabited-Finite-Type l) →
  type-Inhabited-Finite-Type X ≃ type-Inhabited-Finite-Type Y → X ＝ Y
eq-equiv-Inhabited-Finite-Type X Y e =
  eq-type-subtype
    ( λ X → is-inhabited-Prop (type-Finite-Type X))
    ( eq-equiv-𝔽
      ( finite-type-Inhabited-Finite-Type X)
      ( finite-type-Inhabited-Finite-Type Y)
      ( e))
```

### Every type in `UU-Fin (succ-ℕ n)` is an inhabited finite type

```agda
is-finite-and-inhabited-type-UU-Fin-succ-ℕ :
  {l : Level} → (n : ℕ) → (F : UU-Fin l (succ-ℕ n)) →
  is-finite-and-inhabited (type-UU-Fin (succ-ℕ n) F)
pr1 (is-finite-and-inhabited-type-UU-Fin-succ-ℕ n F) =
  is-finite-type-UU-Fin (succ-ℕ n) F
pr2 (is-finite-and-inhabited-type-UU-Fin-succ-ℕ n F) =
  is-inhabited-type-UU-Fin-succ-ℕ n F
