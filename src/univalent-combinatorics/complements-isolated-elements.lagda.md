## Idea

For any element `x` in a [finite type](univalent-combinatorics.finite-types.md)
`X` of [cardinality](set-theory.cardinalities.md) `n+1`, we can construct its
**complement**, which is a type of cardinality `n`.

## Definition

### The complement of a element in a `k`-element type of arbitrary universe level

```agda
isolated-element-Type-With-Cardinality-ℕ :
  {l : Level} (k : ℕ) (X : Type-With-Cardinality-ℕ l (succ-ℕ k)) →

    ( type-Type-With-Cardinality-ℕ (succ-ℕ k)) →
  UU l1
type-complement-element-Type-With-Cardinality-ℕ k (X , x) =

### The action of equivalences on complements of isolated points

```agda
equiv-complement-element-Type-With-Cardinality-ℕ :
  {l1 : Level} (k : ℕ)
  (X Y :
    Σ ( Type-With-Cardinality-ℕ l1 (succ-ℕ k))
      ( type-Type-With-Cardinality-ℕ (succ-ℕ k))) →
  (e : equiv-Type-With-Cardinality-ℕ (succ-ℕ k) (pr1 X) (pr1 Y))
  (p : Id (map-equiv e (pr2 X)) (pr2 Y)) →
  equiv-Type-With-Cardinality-ℕ k
    ( complement-element-Type-With-Cardinality-ℕ k X)
    ( complement-element-Type-With-Cardinality-ℕ k Y)
equiv-complement-element-Type-With-Cardinality-ℕ
  k S T e p =
  equiv-complement-isolated-element e
    ( x , (λ x' → has-decidable-equality-has-cardinality-ℕ (succ-ℕ k) H x x'))
    ( y , (λ y' → has-decidable-equality-has-cardinality-ℕ (succ-ℕ k) K y y'))
    ( p)
  where
  H = pr2 (pr1 S)
  x = pr2 S
  K = pr2 (pr1 T)
  y = pr2 T
```

## Properties

### The map from a pointed `k+1`-element type to the complement of the element is an equivalence

This remains to be shown.
