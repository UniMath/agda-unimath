# The agda-unimath library

Welcome to the agda-unimath project. This is a community-driven effort aimed at
formalizing mathematics from a univalent point of view using the dependently
typed programming language [Agda](https://github.com/agda/agda).

The library project was created by
[Elisabeth Stenholm](https://elisabeth.stenholm.one),
[Jonathan Prieto-Cubides](https://jonaprieto.github.io), and
[Egbert Rijke](https://egbertrijke.github.io), and is currently being maintained
by Egbert Rijke, [Fredrik Bakke](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/fredrik.bakke),
and [Vojtěch Štěpančík](https://vojtechstep.eu/). Our goal is to create an
online encyclopedia of formalized mathematics containing an extensive curriculum
of topics from a univalent point of view. We think libraries of formalized
mathematics have the potential to be useful, and informative resources for both
working and learning mathematicians. Our library is designed to work towards
this goal, and we welcome contributions to the library within any topic in
mathematics.

The agda-unimath library is compatible with Agda 2.8.0 and can be compiled by
running `make check` from the root directory of the repository. Learn more about
using the library locally in our [installation guide](HOWTO-INSTALL.md).

## Participating in the project

If you are interested in contributing to the agda-unimath project, we encourage
you to join the conversation in our
[Univalent Agda discord server](https://discord.gg/Zp2e8hYsuX). This is a
discussion platform shared between the 1Lab, agda-unimath, Cubical Agda, and
TypeTopology communities, where we are more than happy to get you started.

To contribute, fork the library and create a separate branch for your work.
Follow the instructions in our [installation guide](HOWTO-INSTALL.md) to set up
the project. After you have completed your formalization, submit it via a pull
request. We will review your contribution and work towards incorporating it into
the agda-unimath library.
